## Chapter 1

_"Okay, Jiminy, I think we finished here and I have the results. You can put back your shirt."_ said Dr. Lesley Dimantas (capename: Squirrel Girl). _"I know you're a little bored, but Soldaire demanded all of you that had in The Mission That Wasn't to be double-checked before get back to field."_

_"Alright."_ said Joshua McCarthy (capename: Jiminy Cricket), putting back the shirt he was using as he was still in the bench at ORSL 1, the former oil refinery turned into a support base for refugees in international waters at the Mediterrean Sea.

He just was looking for himself in the mirror: since he and part of his team helped Santa (_"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!"_) in the so-called Mission That Wasn't, he had some small physical changes: his previously blonde hair got strawberry blonde, with rosy cheeks and a pert snub nose and an almost rabbity smile. Not that he was totally unconfortable with his face: he always looked a little childish, but now he looks like a Santa Elf, even with slightly pointed ears.

_"Okay..."_ said Lesley _"I have  now good and bad news for your. Which of those you want first?"_

_"Good, obviously."_ demanded Joshua, that is almost 17 now.

_"Good news is: even after absorbing temporaly the powers of an Omega cape, you had almost no consequences. You are as healthy as always, no stats outside the standards."_ smiled Lesley, that had a really rabbity smile, by choice: she's a Metamorph cape that could change herself to any kind of animal, and she could partially change parts of herself, which she used as a kind of fashion.

_"Whoa... Thanks... I need to say I was expecting to suffer some kind of setback after absorbing Santa's Mantle temporaly."_ suspired Joshua gladly

_"In fact, here is the bad news: you didn't passed by this unschated... I double-checked your genetic profile based on the genetic map HSF took when you joined us and I could see that your genetics was changed by the energies involved. Nothing that can be really dangerous, but I can say that those appearence changes was turned permanent, like you took that Santa Helper Clause you talked before."_ said Lesley _"I saw also some markers on your blood and you have a low growth hormone level in your body. This means that you'll look this way: you'll not grew older in appearance. We could say that now you'll look a little Peter Pan too... And about the ears: they could be corrected surgically, but if you ask me, I would be against it."_ 

_"Why?"_ asked Joshua

_"Surgeries are dangerous: we lost this notion now, but think that basically under a surgery you're hurting your body to do something with it. I don't think that do this for aesthetics is a good idea, and look that I'm the one the use squirrel ears as fashion."_ she said, and their squirrely ears moved by their own accord.

_"But I look like an elf!"_ exclaimed Joshua _"How I'll explain this for mom, dad... Disney."_

_"I'll prepare a report on this for Disney and so, explaining that you had contact with energies that changed partialiy your appearance, but otherwise didn't affected you. Which is truth: we just don't need to say that you almost became Santa or burnt your brain down in the process."_ said Lesley _"And about this, think on Grendel: he can't hide the monstrous appearence he has after his breakthrough, but he doesn't let this put him down. I know you'll be able to do the same."_

_"Alright..."_ sighed Joshua

_"I know, Joshua... You'll look a kid forever now... But you did a incredible job, risking yourself while fighting an Ultra villain. I don't think that even Blackstone would say you otherwise. You had some luck, for sure, but I believe that luck came for those who do the right things, and you did. You did put yourself into risk for something even bigger than many people could believe, even knowing that no details could be declassified for, at least, 15 years. I myself would say you're crazy if I didn't know about Operation SANTA."_ exasperated Lesley, talking about the classified operation he participated to, almost literally, save Christmas. 

Asked by NORAD, they had gone to see why Santa Claus didn't talked back wtih NORAD, so they could avoid Santa to be targeted during his yearly voyage around the world, while he used the SANTA callsign. He almost died after trying to rescue Santa from the Ice Queen, stabbed by her with a ritual knife in the left shoulder, which made him absorb Santa's power. He almost died as his body wasn't able to hold too much power for too long, and now he understood he would not pass unschated by the experience.

_"Well..."_ said Joshua _"It could be worst: I could had died, or absorbed Santa Clause and became Santa instead of Sven, or that crazy Ice Queen could had achieved what she wanted... Looking an elf is a small price for this."_

_"Way to go, Jiminy."_ said Lesley. _"Now, you can go. As Eileen to get here in an hour. If you see Seiji, ask him that I'll talk with him after dinner. Think today is your night shift, right?"_

_"Yeah... I'll take Trasport 5 to get to Malta for ressuply after the lunch and when I get back I'll tag for LionHeart. Me, Djanni, Cabby at the night."_ 

_"Now that we are okay with this: I'll say Soldaire we'll need to do some exchanges on your documents, even those classified. Just red paper, but some of this could leav HSF on a problem if not followed. Also, I'll look for your stas and see if there'll be any supplement need: I don't believe it will be needed, but I'll double check. I'll check also your stats regularly, at least once in a month during next two or three years. I don't think there was any real problem, but better safe than sorry. You can go now, Jiminy."_ said Lesley, and Joshua got out the infirmary.

He was walking to the main level in the ORSL 1 platform, sitting on one of the banks Dumont put there so they could take some time and just let the hair down. He needed so much this...

_"Bees on your bucket, Jiminy?"_ said a very faint voice around him, making he springs. He looked around and saw a small, Tinkerbell-like light.
