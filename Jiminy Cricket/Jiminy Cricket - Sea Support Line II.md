# Jiminy Cricket - Sea Support Line II

## Chapter 1

> _"I can't believe I survived the Mission That Wasn't: to receive on yourself the power of an Omega Cape is something that can't happen without consequences."_
>
> _From Jiminy Cricket's Journals_

_"Okay, Jiminy, I think we finished here and I have the results. You can put back your shirt."_ said Dr. Lesley Dimantas (capename: Squirrel Girl). _"I know you're a little bored, but Soldaire demanded all of you that had in The Mission That Wasn't to be double-checked before get back to field."_

_"Alright."_ said Joshua McCarthy (capename: Jiminy Cricket), putting back the shirt he was using as he was still in the bench at ORSL 1, the former oil refinery turned into a support base for refugees in international waters at the Mediterranean Sea.

He just was looking for himself in the mirror: since he and part of his team helped Santa (_"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!"_) in the so-called Mission That Wasn't, he had some small physical changes: his previously blonde hair got strawberry blonde, with rosy cheeks and a pert snub nose and an almost rabbity smile. Not that he was totally uncomfortable with his face: he always looked a little childish, but now he looks like a Santa Elf, even with slightly pointed ears.

_"Okay..."_ said Lesley _"I have  now good and bad news for your. Which of those you want first?"_

_"Good, obviously."_ said Joshua, that is almost 17 now.

_"Good news is: even after absorbing temporally the powers of an Omega cape, you had almost no consequences. You are as healthy as always, no stats outside the standards."_ smiled Lesley, that had a really rabbity smile, by choice: she's a Metamorph cape that could change herself to any kind of animal, and she could partially change parts of herself, which she used as a kind of fashion.

_"Whoa... Thanks... I need to say I was expecting to suffer some kind of setback after absorbing Santa's Mantle temporally."_ suspired Joshua gladly

_"In fact, here is the bad news: you didn't passed by this unschated... I double-checked your genetic profile based on the genetic map HSF took when you joined us and I could see that your genetics was changed by the energies involved. Nothing that can be really dangerous, but I can say that those appearance changes was turned permanent, like you took that Santa Helper Clause you talked before."_ said Lesley _"I saw also some markers on your blood and you have a low growth hormone level in your body. This means that you'll look this way: you'll not grew older in appearance. We could say that now you'll look a little Peter Pan too... And about the ears: they are permanent, like you had born with them. They could be corrected surgically, but if you ask me, I would be against it."_ 

_"Why?"_ asked Joshua

_"Surgeries are dangerous: we lost this notion now, but think that basically under a surgery you're hurting your body to do something with it. I don't think that take those risks for aesthetics is a good idea, even more for a cape, and look that I'm the one the use squirrel ears as fashion."_ she said, and their squirrely ears moved by their own accord.

_"But I look like an elf!"_ exclaimed Joshua _"How I'll explain this for mom, dad... Disney!"_

_"I'll prepare a report on this for Disney and so, explaining that you had contact with energies that changed partially your appearance, but otherwise didn't affected you. Which is truth: we just don't need to say that you almost became Santa or burnt your brain down in the process."_ said Lesley _"And about this, think on Grendel: he can't hide the monstrous appearance he has after his breakthrough, but he doesn't let this put him down. I know you'll be able to do the same."_

_"Alright..."_ sighed Joshua

_"I know, Joshua... You'll look a kid forever now... But you did a incredible job, risking yourself while fighting an Ultra villain. I don't think that even Blackstone would say you otherwise. You had some luck, for sure, but I believe that luck came for those who do the right things, and you did. You did put yourself into risk for something even bigger than many people could believe, even knowing that no details could be declassified for, at least, 15 years. I myself would say you're crazy if I didn't know about Operation SANTA."_ exasperated Lesley, talking about the classified operation he participated to, almost literally, save Christmas. 

Asked by NORAD, they had gone to see why Santa Claus didn't talked back with NORAD, so they could avoid Santa to be targeted during his yearly voyage around the world, while he used the SANTA callsign. He almost died after trying to rescue Santa from the Ice Queen, stabbed by her with a ritual knife in the left shoulder, which made him absorb Santa's power. He almost died as his body wasn't able to hold too much power for too long, and now he understood he would not pass unschated by the experience. The worst is, this would be classified, so no one would know about the mission who never was.

_"Well..."_ said Joshua _"It could be worst: I could had died, or absorbed Santa Clause and became Santa instead of Sven, or that crazy Ice Queen could had achieved what she wanted... Looking an elf is a small price for this."_

_"Way to go, Jiminy."_ said Lesley. _"Now, you can go. AsK Eileen to get here in an hour. If you see Seiji, ask him that I'll talk with him after dinner. Think today is your night shift, right?"_

_"Yeah... I'll take Transport 5 to get to Malta for resupply after the lunch and when I get back I'll tag for LionHeart. Me, Djanni, Cabby at the night."_ 

_"Now that we are okay with this: I'll say Soldaire we'll need to do some exchanges on your documents, even those classified. Just red paper, but some of this could leave HSF on a problem if not followed. Also, I'll look for your stats and see if there'll be any supplement need: I don't believe it will be needed, but I'll double check. I'll check also your stats regularly, at least once in a month during next two or three years. I don't think there was any real problem, but better safe than sorry. You can go now, Jiminy."_ said Lesley, and Joshua got out the infirmary.

He was walking to the main level in the ORSL 1 platform, sitting on one of the banks Dumont put there so they could take some time and just let the hair down. He needed so much this...

_"Bees on your bucket, Jiminy?"_ said a very faint voice around him, making he springs. He looked around and saw a small, Tinkerbell-like light.

_"Oh, it's you, Eileen."_ he retorted, a little angry while her grow back the size of an young woman, as she's now 25.

_"How it was with Lesley? I believe that was not so good, if you came here to see the waves."_ asked Eileen, that wasn't on her half-ballerina half-fairy costume, but on a jeans and tank top that gave some space in her back so her fairy wings could get in and out when needed. Eileen retracted the wings back her before sitting aside Joshua.

_"Well... According her, I'm totally healthy and passed almost unscathed over absorbing temporally Santa's Mantle..."_ stated Joshua, when he complimented _"However, according her, my genetic profile was changed by the sheer energy of Santa's Mantle: my pert nose and cheeks and pointed ears are permanent, as if I signed myself a Santa Helper Clause. And more: looks like I'll not grow anymore, in the biological sense."_

_"And... What you are worried about? It's not like you take AIDS or Cancer or anything else... You are healthy and fit for the job."_ commented Eileen

_"How much time I'll still be_ short stuff?" said Joshua on a little higher voice _"People don't took me seriously before and now they'll take me even less seriously: I look like a little elf kid!"_

Eileen looked to him for some moments and then said: _"You have a point, Jiminy, but you are not totally right. People didn't took you seriously in the past because you were either young and less experienced. And now, looking like a little elf, maybe they'll never take you seriously. However,"_ she emphasized _"think on the glass half-full: your powers are more useful on this way: when people don't take you too much seriously, they let their guard down, and with this you can use your_ Pretty Please! _with more chances of being successful. And your other capabilities, like_ Bellax Analytica _or your powerful mind or_ Blue Fairy _are useful, no matter how your appearance are."_ she said 

_"But... About the others..."_ she said meekly

_"Hey, Joshua. You_ grew _aside us: you were a full-fledged hero with 11, with us! We all know how powerful you are, and how skillfully you grew, and how competent you turned yourself on your job. We all know that you are really competent, elf ears or not."_ said Eileen _"I don't think anyone in our team would take you down because you look now like a cute elf, and take this as a compliment."_ she said, when Joshua looked contemptuously for her.

_"Looks like I'll be always a Pooh Bear for you, right?"_ he pouted

_"You silly bear."_ she giggled _"You'll be always the same Joshua I got in the Zurich airport and was dressed into Disney clothes. Hey, I think what can help you. And we'll have a bench time next week. What do you think to go to Chicago? The Harlequin invited us for a mixed team exercises with the Chicago Sentinels and Young Sentinels also. And obviously there'll be some time at The Fortress. And, I need to say, maybe we need to give a glow on your look: you're still too much Disney."_ she giggled 

He huffed and puffed, but he noted he need some hair down:

_"Alright. But we'll discuss this all later: need to do bring those supplies from Malta and today is night shift for me, so I want to take a lunch before taking four or five hours with Transport 5."_ he said, trying to look serious, which made him look like a spoiled brat.

_"Right... I'll put The Harlequin in touch. I don't know if we'll go full power or if we'll go with our Junior team: you, me, Marjanah, Scheherazade, Lahab, Presto and Djanni."_ said Sugarplum. _"We'll need to see if Colocation, Prop, Sukhoi and Split/Second from ORSL 7 can help us."_

_"Alright."_ said Joshua _"And thanks for this: I need to say that all that elf thing that happened with me is messing a little with me."_

_"It's okay: you passed by an experience so rare and weird and dangerous that no one beside you can say how much it was painful. But you had passed by it alive, and there's a thing that my gramps said sometime:_ 'if you pass through something dangerous alive, you did something right. Learn with the experience.' _That Ice Queen bitch was really powerful, but I saw you under Santa's power and it was really over 9000. I don't think even Ozma would pass alive through that, even more unscathed, to try and hold that power for so long as you did. You are alive, so you did something right. Learn from it."_

_"Right..."_ said Joshua, when his belly rumbled a little, making him blush even more.

_"Looks someone need to stuff yourself."_ she said _"Let us have a lunch, and then we think about those things."_

## Chapter 2

> _"It's weird, but I don't think the glamorous life is so good. I know that some PR is part of the job of a cape, but need to say that I don't like this."_
>
> *__Jiminy Cricket__, "A Living Conscience: some musings from a life Wearing the Cape"*

_"Looks like you really need a glow on your look."_ said The Harlequin, looking for the costume Jiminy was using. _"I know it's okay, and you act in deserts and so, too much afar from the limelights, but this costume is too much... Plain... Meh... Capes are known about style: we need to show people something over-the-top, it is what is expected on Capes. And the PR and merchandise effect on a stylish costume is better than a plain costume like this. I know that your Jiminy Cricket costume is sold by Disney, but based on your design, and some of the profits are reverted to_ Herós Sans Frontières."

_"How do you know about this? It was an agreement Disney came with HSF when I became a cape and they tried to sue HSF for Copyright infringement!"_ said Jiminy

_"I have my sources, and even being 'secret', things goes very fast behind the scene on the cape world. We are a somewhat small lot, it's easy to look for the correct gossip if you have the sources."_ The Harlequin said _"And remember that, aside my powers, I'm also trained as PR for The Sentinels."_

Jiminy was into his common costume, the same he started his life as a cape:  green pants, dark green tails, blue scarf around the neck passing as a cravat for his white starched shirt topped by green waistcoat, black boots, a half mask shaped as a cricket face and a top hat. As always, he looked like like a kid that took some Dress-Up Game costume as cape costume.

_"I know that this is a good costume, but we need something more... Adult... Not something that a kid could take from the Costume racks on_ Walmart. _We need something that put some mystery on your look. This way, I think we can cover the base on this elf ears and cheeks thing: faces are easily concealable behind masks, even half-masks giving the so-called Clark Kent to split you on civil from you on cape. To be honest, think we should go with Domino mask for you: your freckled face and cheek can bring some woo that could put a good mysterious look on you, and this could be a nice thing. And because your strawberry blonde hair, we can go something steampunk: some brass and shiny embroidments, maybe a good pocket watch that, aside looking stylish, could be a good place to put some gizmos. The hat could go a little Mad Hatter: bigger on the top, slim on the trim, and with some brass or copper embroidments... I think Andrew already have some ideas."_

_"Hope this isn't too costly. I don't want everyone saying that I'm hogging resources from HSF that could be sent for refugees or anything like this."_ talked Jiminy

_"Talked with Andrew, and this will be all_ pro bono. _Looks like a good PR for him, also. Besides, some of the most exclusive costumes he does for capes all around are replicated by cosplayers, and maybe you can be a spearhead for a new product line for cosplayers that want the best. Obviously not so complete: cosplayers doesn't have to deal with supervillains on regular basis."_ she finished, while Andrew was measuring him. _"I think we can start with a little darker colors, and under velvety tones and patterns. This could emphasis the hair and face, and add on the mystery. Otherwise, we can stay on your basic design with a Victorian suit, and go from this. Andrew has already some design sketchs, let us see if there's something you like."_ said The Harlequin, while Andrew came with a small binder.

Jiminy knew that Andrew was the Gianni Versacce for capes: only the _creme-de-la-creme_ had access for his designs. So, he thought, Disney would already know about him and about him redoing his cape. He was almost to ask The Harlequin about this when she said, almost like she read his mind.

_"I believe that Andrew worked with Disney in the past, for some redesing on the Disney Park princess' design, including some for the new cape-focused styles for princesses, Mickey and villains. And looks like they asked also for a more casual redesign for Mickey, but this is all under nondisclosure agreements."_ said The Harlequin, nonchalantly, like it was just a small fact _"Let us see..."_

Jiminy saw sketch after sketch, until Sugarplum looked for Jiminy:

_"This one looks promising, right?"_ she asked

It was a dark green tails, with some engravings and embroidments on a kind of rusty gold thread. The waistcoat was on a light, leathery brown, with the same embroidments. The hat was a little like a Mad Hatter, smaller in the brim than in the top, in the same dark green. Pants on a lighter tone of green that gone into a pair of leathery boots. The shirt bellow was simple white, and there was a scarf cravat on a little "dirty" yellow, with some brown shades. The gloves were pure white and there was also a belt in rusty gold...

_"Like this one..."_ looked Jiminy. _"I have some issues only with the mask. I don't think this would be good: this kind of mask sound too villainy for me... No offense, Quin."_ said Jiminy

_"Apology accepted."_ said The Harlequin, that normally uses the Domino Mask. _"We can include a half-mask option if you like. Also, we can go for a Zorro mask that can cover discreetly your ear tips. Otherwise, looks like a really really cool style. A little cheeky, but not too much sensual. It shows nicely yourself and put some mystery, like a Victorian vigilante, elegant and mysterious. You are not exactly well-built, but also not too much chubby anymore, and the clothes will make you look just a little slender, which will make you look so princely handsome."_ she said, turning the page and showing the half-mask and some extra accessories.

_"For you to use on daily basis, as you need to do some maintenance on the helicopters and so, Andrew thought on this faux leather apron look, without the tails, using the Zorro Mask and Top Hat. This look'll  be_ very _steampunk, even more with the cricket shaped pilot goggles that are a third option for your eyes. The clothes will be all on the best fabrics, silk and satin shirts and good leather high-kneeled boots, like those used by riders, and with space for some new Kevlar like Vernetech ballistic protections."_ said The Harlequin

Jiminy smiled 

_"I like this one: is not too much afar from what I'm used to, but is cool."_ said Jiminy

_"Alright: I think we can do this until you need to get back ORSL 1 after the common exercises. Andrew will also ready some more formal costumes, with black pants and tails and rusty yellow waistcoat, and some variations for warm weathers, with cooler fabrics, and for cold weathers."_ said The Harlequin, closing the binder _"And I think that someone that saved Christmas needs the best."_

_"How you know..."_

_"I've said before."_ retorted smiling The Harlequin _"If you hear the gossip on the right places, you can infere more things than you can imagine."_

_"And this gossip had come from a certain asset from NORAD?"_ smirked Jiminy

_"You didn't heard that from those lips."_ said The Harlequin, and they all smiled a little: she knew how to do the gossip game, in fact she was a mistress on this one. _"Now... What about some lunch before the exercises?"_ said The Harlequin.

---

The exercises were intensive: as his team was really green, they learned a lot of new tricks. Sugarplum loved to act aside Ozma: as the Queen of Oz, she had lots of powers and techniques that Sugarplum could learn with her.

_"Your magic tradition is totally different from what I learned with Glinda, but you're a good learner and understand easily the basics. I think you could be a great Good Witch if you had been born on Oz. Later I can gave you some tips and books on the mystic Oz Alchemy, and believe me you'll never find anything better on this on any magical realm."_ said Ozma, on the same cool, royally nonchalantly tone she always have. Ozma would be royal under almost all circumstances, even on a common training like this one.

_"Alright."_ said Blackstone. _"Think we already have some good parameters on working with HSF: they had taken some pages from our book, but they also written some good pages we can take for ours, as they are more experienced on natural disasters. Astra, I want you, Sugarplum and Jiminy Cricket to be with me for some extra evaluations. I would be glad you came for my room as soon we arrive at The Dome."_

They got into The Dome and, while the others got for some confraternization (including some videogames), Jiminy, Sugarplum and Astra got to Blackstone's room: Jiminy would never get totally used with Blackstone room, that he saw once or twice before, even without being a _Sentinel_: the same magical posters all around and stage magic stuff. 

However, there was someone else there:

_"Soldaire?"_ asked Jiminy.

_"Hey, Jiminy. Looked your action with Sugarplum, and need to say you're really grow over as a field leader."_ said Soldaire

_"In fact, I would not say better, Mr. Shirou."_ said Blackstone _"I remember when you were a reckless kid that accidentally killed a bad guy. Now, you was someone that done lots of good actions all around the world and didn't falter even in the direst situations, some of them I doubt even my so dearly deceased friends Gibbons and Chandler would pass through unscathed."_

Charles Gibbons (capename: Ajax) and John Chandler (capename: Atlas) were two of the founders of _Chicago Sentinels_ in the wake of The Event: in fact, the first video registry of a superhuman involved Atlas holding an airplane that was falling down, helping it to land safely at O'Hare airport. Both of them lost their lives on the Whittier Base attack after The Big One, the expected earthquake that fractured California from the continental America, both of them on the hands of the terrible villain called Seif-Al-Din. 

_"In fact, this training had shown how much skilled you three are as field leaders. Astra, I want to talk with you in private about your strong and weak spots as_ Young Sentinels _leader. And I think that Mr. Shirou wants to take some talk with Sugarplum and Jiminy Cricket also. Could we use your room here, Ms. Corrigan?"_ asked Blackstone, with a hint of a tone that said that he knew something that no one else there knows.

_"Alright."_ said Astra, and both of them got out the room

Sugarplum and Jiminy looked for Soldaire: for some reason, they took a hint of sadness on his face, hidden on his_ on the duty _stance: as always, when not in his_ SolArmor, _he was on his best_ Keichisou _police officer uniform._

_"First of all: I want you to hold all we say here as classified for a time, including the others. There will be soon a formal release and so. Dumont already know what I'm to talk about, and Squirrel Girl too, but the others doesn't know."_ said Soldaire.

_"Recently, some time before the Christmas Mission, I was feeling tired very fast after using the_ SolArmor. _Even with my training, it was making me get fast, too near from pass out while on the Armor, what would be a serious business. While you got back from Christmas' Mission, I had gone to Japan for a meeting with_ Defensenet, _and then I passed with Doctor Hisagawa_, SolArmor'_s creator."_

_"We did some tests and the results were no good: for some reason, the_ SolArmor _grew incompatible with my biological signature. Doctor Hisagawa started a new project, called_ SolArmor Next, _to create a new generation of_ SolArmors, _for me and others. I still have SolArmor with me, but I'd been counseled to avoid use it as far as possible, so I could stay healthy."_

_"What?"_ shocked Sugarplum _"But you are our field leader!"_

_"Unfortunately this is no more truth, at least not in the immediate future. If I pass out, I need to be taken from the front and the SolArmor needs to be removed like a big and clumsy motorsport firesuit, and this would be a problem for my health. So, I'm now in fact a liability, a weak spot."_

_"Now, before we go forward, I think you both know that I'm what HSF calls as a_ seeder, _someone that helps teams to grow up and over until they can walk by themselves. And need to say that you are one of the most incredible teams I saw, from the time there was both Kuntur, me, LionHeart and Hufflepuff until now, that we are a spearhead on ORSL project, one of the most important projects for_ Herós Sans Frontières."

_"And I just received from Geneva an invitation for training new teams there, as ORSL project, Roque Santeiro and so needed now new capes to replace those that are growing older and so. And they know about my_ SolArmor _problem, so I'm now almost useless in the field."_

_"What I want from you is: you'll be both field leaders for our team, and I say our as I never said before for any team. Sugarplum, you'll be the one to be field leader for the team as a whole, but I want Jiminy Cricket to be your Astra."_

_"What you are talking about?"_ asked Jiminy

_"Jiminy will be the leader on what I'm calling_ Le Jeune Herós Sans Frontières, _the Young Heroes Without Border. In fact, I think will just formalizing what always happened: Presto, Djanni, Marjanah, Scheherazade and Lahab trust you as never would trust someone older, Jiminy. I don't think I have anything else to teach to both of you. Dumont accepted to be the administrative and PR leader, as I know you don't like the red paper, Sugarplum. And a good field leader can't be too flashy, as he's the one that coordinates all actions in field, and passing out on some Foxtrot is a problem."_

_"Why me?"_ said Jiminy

_"Well, beside saving Christmas, and rescuing some refugees abducted by the_ Caliphate WITHOUT _your powers... Nothing special."_ said Soldaire, nonchalantly _"You need to understand, Jiminy, that you are really powerful: I saw the small Pinocchio fan grew into a great hero. Not great on size, to be fair, but on power and, above all, skill and attitude."_

_"But..."_ 

_"Jiminy,"_ said Sugarplum _"we all came into an accord: your powers are better to be used when you are the field leader. Obviously, you may need to fight supervillains or do the dirty work time and another, as we all saw in Christmas Village and Ice Queen Castle. And you did it very well. But without Seiji we'll need even more a good field leader, and I'll need your help on the team as a whole and with the teenagers like you. It's time to you to show all your potential for real."_

Jiminy thought on all the six years since he became a full-fledged cape: he fought better when in a team. To be fair, even he being powerful on his _Pretty Please!_, this power would be better used if he could be safe. And now it would be time to take a next step: to be what Soldaire was for him.

_"I think I can do this."_ said Jiminy.

_"Alright..."_ said Soldaire, gladly _"I had some fear you denied: I believe you and Sugarplum we'll be incredible leaders: you two have the profile to be the team leader. I don't want you to be full of yourself, Jiminy, but I don't think Blackstone could be a so good information profiler than you. He's better, by sure, but he has_ ages _of experience you don't have. I really believe you'll do well. So, let us go: think the team is wainting you."_ 

_"Sure."_ said Sugarplum _"And thank you too, Jiminy: I don't think I would be able to deal with a big team like ours just by myself."_

_"No problem at all."_ said Jiminy.

## Chapter 3

The team had split for confraternization: the biggest share stayed there in The Dome while Jiminy, Sugarplum, Dumont, Soldaire and the Sentinel girls got for The Fortres, the dance club/café/memorabilia museum from Chicago.

_"Don't worry about the place."_ said The Harlequin, looking for Sugarplum and Jiminy _"Today is a more family friendly day, not too much a hype day."_

When Jiminy got there, remembered him Hard Rock Cafe or, with not, Le Cafe Mickey on Disneyworld: lots of cape memorabilia, including posters and costume sets and even some weapons.

_"Those are not functional, of course. No one wants an accident. But they are really used in the past."_ said The Harlequin

There was little crowd in that night: some cosplayers fans, or just fans, some common people that just wanted good food and drink and some of the local capes, some that were in the combined exercises just today. Jiminy could recognize SaFire, the B-Class Atlas that was focused on EMT rescue, instead of a fighter like Astra. 

_"Okay, let us try some appetizer and drinks. No alcohol for you today, Jiminy."_ said Sugarplum _"You're still underage for alcohol."_

_"Okay."_ thought Jiminy

Jiminy was into his new costume set, that had a little Mad Hatter on it now, but he liked: it was more comfy, even being a little tighter on the knees thanks to the high-kneeled riding boots. 

They sat on The Table, the exclusive _Sentinels_ table: they could see that it was that because it had the _Sentinels_ crest over the table, the same stylished S they could see in Astra's buckle.

_"What about some beers for the big ones and Cola for the kid? And the fries here are fantastic."_ asked The Harlequin

_"Alright."_ said Sugarplum _"And then we could eat something."_

There came some big glasses with the beers and cola and some appetizers.

_"Need to say that you are really good on those clothes."_ said Chakra to Jiminy _"Your tantric flow looks so better now. When I saw you when you arrived today, I could saw that you chakras were too much opened. Maybe a reflex of your secret experiences recently?"_

_"Can you see all this?"_ said Jiminy

_"Right. Tantric yoga is not about_ sex, _at least not exclusively, but about_ life. _Life in all expressions, life with all meanings, unrestricted and unfettered. Sex is obviously part of life, but by no means is the main thing or the only thing."_ said Chakra

_"So dull talk, Chakra, let us talk about guys!"_ said The Harlequin

_"You are the one who had brought a minor with us."_ replied Astra _"But what about talking on something else. Lighter things. Books?"_

_"There's this series about a magician..."_ chirped somehow Jiminy, when they looked to him 

_"Hey, like those things."_ talked Astra, trying to make Jiminy comfortable _"Tell us more."_

They started to do a small Reading club, talking about the things they all liked to read. Jiminy discovered some nice things, like how much The Harlequin liked to read bibliographies, and Chakra read almost all the sacred books around the world, from the _Bhagavad-Gita_ to _The Bible_ to the _Q'uran_ to some books from the Ba'h'ai.

It was a good time for everyone, when they saw a small mist getting aside him

_"Had some problems, Artemis?"_ asked The Harlequin

_"Some drug dealers. Nothing that bad, but detoured a little."_ she said. Jiminy knew that Artemis was a Supernatural cape, a vampire, with the full package except the Progenity: she could bite someone all the time, but she would never make another vampire. She also could not be turned away by holy symbols or crossing waters and so. Holy water works, however, as far he knew, as also would work sunlight. And when sleeping she would be always like a corpse.

_"We spared some Blood Mary for you."_ said Astra, passing the drink for her.

_"Thanks."_ she said _"And this is Jiminy Cricket, right? I remember you from that revalidation test. You did well on that time and, by what I heard, you did even better that year."_

_"Right. Nice to see you again too."_ said Jiminy, drinking a big gulp from his cup, when he felt something weird that made him gulp his drink in. _"Hey, this is not coke."_

_"Let me see..."_ said Artemis _"Someone had exchanged your cup. This is dark beer."_

_"Oh, sorry..."_ said the barman _"I'll provide a new cup."_

Jiminy looked a little weird.

_"What happened, Jiminy?"_ said Dumont, when they all saw Jiminy run

_"Dumont!"_ said Blue Fairy via his Earbug _"Looks like that beer made Jiminy go sick."_

_"What?"_ said Dumont, when he looked for the girls. _"Just a minute, I'll see for Jiminy. Blue Fairy just said that the beer made him go sick."_

Dumont got to the bathroom were he could hear Jiminy barfing on the toilet.

_"What happened, Blue Fairy? This were poisoned?"_ asked Dumont

_"Not as far I could analyse. What I felt on Jiminy's stats is that the alcohol had skyrocketed went inside him. It was like he took a vodka bottle on an instant!"_ said Blue Fairy _"I'm saving this data for the doctors look upon in the future, but it's weird: it was just a gulp, it should not react that way."_ she said via Earbug, while Jiminy got back on his feet.

_"Just a minute, Jiminy."_ said Dumont _"Go for the sink and wash your mouth from the vomit. This will help you. How are you?"_

_"A little sick."_ said Jiminy _"Never thought dark beer was that bad."_

_"They are strong, but not enough to make someone go that sick so fast."_ said Dumont _"Blue Fairy, send this ASAP for Squirrel Girl."_

_"Do you think this could be about the Santa Mantle?"_ asked Jiminy, flabbergasted

_"Later with this... Better?"_ questioned Dumont

_"I'm feeling everything spinning around me, and I'm feeling sick and weak."_ said Jiminy

_"Congratulations, Jiminy."_ joked Dumont _"You just got Guiness Record for the fastest first hangover in history. And is ironic that Guiness is a beer company in Ireland. Let me help you back."_

_"That's horrible."_ said Jiminy, passing his hand back Dumont and supporting his weight on him.

They got back
