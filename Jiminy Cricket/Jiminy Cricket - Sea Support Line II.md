# Jiminy Cricket - Sea Support Line II

## Chapter 1

> _"I can't believe I survived the Mission That Wasn't: to receive on yourself the power of an Omega Cape is something that can't happen without consequences."_
>
> _From Jiminy Cricket's Journals_

_"Okay, Jiminy, I think we finished here and I have the results. You can put back your shirt."_ said Dr. Lesley Dimantas (capename: Squirrel Girl). _"I know you're a little bored, but Soldaire demanded all of you that had in The Mission That Wasn't to be double-checked before get back to field."_

_"Alright."_ said Joshua McCarthy (capename: Jiminy Cricket), putting back the shirt he was using as he was still in the bench at ORSL 1, the former oil refinery turned into a support base for refugees in international waters at the Mediterrean Sea.

He just was looking for himself in the mirror: since he and part of his team helped Santa (_"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!"_) in the so-called Mission That Wasn't, he had some small physical changes: his previously blonde hair got strawberry blonde, with rosy cheeks and a pert snub nose and an almost rabbity smile. Not that he was totally unconfortable with his face: he always looked a little childish, but now he looks like a Santa Elf, even with slightly pointed ears.

_"Okay..."_ said Lesley _"I have  now good and bad news for your. Which of those you want first?"_

_"Good, obviously."_ demanded Joshua, that is almost 17 now.

_"Good news is: even after absorbing temporaly the powers of an Omega cape, you had almost no consequences. You are as healthy as always, no stats outside the standards."_ smiled Lesley, that had a really rabbity smile, by choice: she's a Metamorph cape that could change herself to any kind of animal, and she could partially change parts of herself, which she used as a kind of fashion.

_"Whoa... Thanks... I need to say I was expecting to suffer some kind of setback after absorbing Santa's Mantle temporaly."_ suspired Joshua gladly

_"In fact, here is the bad news: you didn't passed by this unschated... I double-checked your genetic profile based on the genetic map HSF took when you joined us and I could see that your genetics was changed by the energies involved. Nothing that can be really dangerous, but I can say that those appearence changes was turned permanent, like you took that Santa Helper Clause you talked before."_ said Lesley _"I saw also some markers on your blood and you have a low growth hormone level in your body. This means that you'll look this way: you'll not grew older in appearance. We could say that now you'll look a little Peter Pan too... And about the ears: they are permanent, like you had born with them. They could be corrected surgically, but if you ask me, I would be against it."_ 

_"Why?"_ asked Joshua

_"Surgeries are dangerous: we lost this notion now, but think that basically under a surgery you're hurting your body to do something with it. I don't think that take those risks for aesthetics is a good idea, even more for a cape, and look that I'm the one the use squirrel ears as fashion."_ she said, and their squirrely ears moved by their own accord.

_"But I look like an elf!"_ exclaimed Joshua _"How I'll explain this for mom, dad... Disney!"_

_"I'll prepare a report on this for Disney and so, explaining that you had contact with energies that changed partialiy your appearance, but otherwise didn't affected you. Which is truth: we just don't need to say that you almost became Santa or burnt your brain down in the process."_ said Lesley _"And about this, think on Grendel: he can't hide the monstrous appearence he has after his breakthrough, but he doesn't let this put him down. I know you'll be able to do the same."_

_"Alright..."_ sighed Joshua

_"I know, Joshua... You'll look a kid forever now... But you did a incredible job, risking yourself while fighting an Ultra villain. I don't think that even Blackstone would say you otherwise. You had some luck, for sure, but I believe that luck came for those who do the right things, and you did. You did put yourself into risk for something even bigger than many people could believe, even knowing that no details could be declassified for, at least, 15 years. I myself would say you're crazy if I didn't know about Operation SANTA."_ exasperated Lesley, talking about the classified operation he participated to, almost literally, save Christmas. 

Asked by NORAD, they had gone to see why Santa Claus didn't talked back wtih NORAD, so they could avoid Santa to be targeted during his yearly voyage around the world, while he used the SANTA callsign. He almost died after trying to rescue Santa from the Ice Queen, stabbed by her with a ritual knife in the left shoulder, which made him absorb Santa's power. He almost died as his body wasn't able to hold too much power for too long, and now he understood he would not pass unschated by the experience.

_"Well..."_ said Joshua _"It could be worst: I could had died, or absorbed Santa Clause and became Santa instead of Sven, or that crazy Ice Queen could had achieved what she wanted... Looking an elf is a small price for this."_

_"Way to go, Jiminy."_ said Lesley. _"Now, you can go. As Eileen to get here in an hour. If you see Seiji, ask him that I'll talk with him after dinner. Think today is your night shift, right?"_

_"Yeah... I'll take Trasport 5 to get to Malta for ressuply after the lunch and when I get back I'll tag for LionHeart. Me, Djanni, Cabby at the night."_ 

_"Now that we are okay with this: I'll say Soldaire we'll need to do some exchanges on your documents, even those classified. Just red paper, but some of this could leav HSF on a problem if not followed. Also, I'll look for your stas and see if there'll be any supplement need: I don't believe it will be needed, but I'll double check. I'll check also your stats regularly, at least once in a month during next two or three years. I don't think there was any real problem, but better safe than sorry. You can go now, Jiminy."_ said Lesley, and Joshua got out the infirmary.

He was walking to the main level in the ORSL 1 platform, sitting on one of the banks Dumont put there so they could take some time and just let the hair down. He needed so much this...

_"Bees on your bucket, Jiminy?"_ said a very faint voice around him, making he springs. He looked around and saw a small, Tinkerbell-like light.

_"Oh, it's you, Eileen."_ he retorted, a little angry while her grow back the size of an young woman, as she's now 25.

_"How it was with Lesley? I believe that was not so good, if you came here to see the waves."_ asked Eileen, that wasn't on her half-ballerina half-fairy costume, but on a jeans and tank top that gave some space in her back so her fairy wings could get in and out when needed. Eileen retracted the wings back her before sitting aside Joshua.

_"Well... According her, I'm totally healthy and passed almost unscathed over absorbing temporaly Santa's Mantle..."_ stated Joshua, when he complimented _"However, according her, my genetic profile was changed by the sheer energy of Santa's Mantle: my pert nose and cheeks and pointed ears are permanent, as if I signed myself a Santa Helper Clause. And more: looks like I'll not grow anymore, in the biological sense."_

_"And... What you are worried about? It's not like you take AIDS or Cancer or anything else... You are healthy and fit for the job."_ commented Eileen

_"How much time I'll still be_ short stuff?" said Joshua on a little higher voice _"People don't took me seriously before and now they'll take me even less seriously: I look like a little elf kid!"_

Eileen looked to him for some moments and then said: _"You have a point, Jiminy, but you are not totally right. People didn't took you seriously in the past because you were either young and less experienced. And now, looking like a little elf, maybe they'll never take you seriously. However,"_ she emphatizied _"think on the glass half-full: your powers are more useful on this way: when people don't take you too much seriously, they let their guard down, and with this you can use your_ Pretty Please! _with more chances of being successful. And your other capabilities, like_ Bellax Analytica _or your powerful mind or_ Blue Fairy _are useful, no matter how your appearance are."_ she said 

_"But... About the others..."_ she said meekly

_"Hey, Joshua. You_ grew _aside us: you were a full-fledged hero with 11, with us! We all know how powerful you are, and how skillfully you grew, and how competent you turned yourself on your job. We all know that you are really competent, elf ears or not."_ said Eileen _"I don't think anyone in our team would take you down because you look now like a cute elf, and take this as a cumpliment."_ she said, when Joshua looked comtemptuosly for her.

_"Looks like I'll be always a Pooh Bear for you, right?"_ he pouted

_"You silly bear."_ she giggled _"You'll be always the same Joshua I got in the Zurich airport and was dressed into Disney clothes. Hey, I think what can help you. And we'll have a bench time next week. What do you think to go to Chicago? The Harlequin invited us for a mixed team exercises with the Chicago Sentinels and Young Sentinels also. And obviously there'll be some time at The Fortress. And, I need to say, maybe we need to give a glow on your look: you're still too much Disney."_ she giggled 

He huffed and puffed, but he noted he need some hair down:

_"Alright. But we'll discuss this all later: need to do bring those supplies from Malta and today is night shift for me, so I want to take a lunch before taking four or five hours with Transport 5."_ he said, trying to look serious, which made him look like a spoiled brat.

_"Right... I'll put The Harlequin in touch. I don't know if we'll go full power or if we'll go with our Junior team: you, me, Marjanah, Scheherazade, Lahab, Presto and Djanni."_ said Sugarplum. _"We'll need to see if Colocation, Prop, Sukhoi and Split/Second from ORSL 7 can help us."_

_"Alright."_ said Joshua _"And thanks for this: I need to say that all that elf thing that happened with me is messing a little with me."_

_"It's okay: you passed by an experience so rare and weird and dangerous that no one beside you can say how much it was painful. But you had passed by it alive, and there's a thing that my gramps said sometime:_ 'if you pass thorugh something dangerous alive, you did something right. Learn with the experience.' _That Ice Queen bitch was really powerful, but I saw you and your power was really over 9000. I don't think even Ozma would get alive that, even more unscathed. You are alive, so you did something right. Lear from it."_

_"Right..."_ said Joshua, when his belly rumbled a little, making him blush even more.

_"Looks someone need to stuff yourself."_ she said _"Let us have a lunch, and then we think about those things."_

## Chapter 2

> _"It's weird, but I don't think the glamourous life is so good. I know that some PR is part of the job of a cape, but need to say that I don't like this."_
>
> *__Jiminy Cricket__, "A Living Conscience: some musings from a life Wearing the Cape"*

_"Looks like you really need a glow on your look."_ said The Harlequin, looking for the costume Jiminy was using. _"I know it's okay, and you act in deserts and so, but is too much... Plain... Meh... Capes are known about style: we need to show people something over-the-top, it is what is expected on Capes. And the PR and merchandise effect on a stylish costume is better than a plain costume. And I know that your Jiminy Cricket costume is sold by Disney, but based on your design, and some of the profits are reverted to_ Herós Sans Frontières."

_"How do you know about this? It was an agreement Disney came with HSF when I became a cape and they tried to sue HSF for Copyright infringement!"_ said Jiminy

_"I have my sources, and even being 'secret', things goes very fast behind the scene on the cape world. We are a somewhat small lot, it's easy to look for the correct gossip if you have the sources."_ The Harlequin said _"And remember that, aside my powers, I'm also trained as PR for The Sentinels."_

Jiminy was into his common costume, the same he started his life as a cape:  green pants, dark green tails, blue scarf around the neck passing as a cravat for his white starched shirt topped by green waistcoat, black boots, a half mask shaped as a cricket face and a top hat. As always, he looked like like a kid that took some Dress-Up Game costume as cape costume.

_"I know that this is a good costume, but we need something more... Adult... Not something that a kid could take from the Costume racks on_ Walmart. _This way, I think we can cover the base on this elf ears and cheeks thing: faces are easily conceilable behind masks, even half-masks giving the so-called Clark Kent to split you on civil from you on cape. To be honest, think we should go with Domino mask for you: your freckled face and cheek can bring some woo that could put a good mystery look on you, and this could be a nice thing. And because your strawberry blonde hair, we can go something steampunk: some brass and shiny embroidements, maybe a good pocket watch that, aside looking stylish, could be a good place to put some gizmos. The hat could go a little Mad Hatter: bigger on the top, slim on the trim, and with some brass or copper embroidements... I think Andrew already have some ideas."_

_"Hope this isn't too costly. I don't want everyone saying that I'm hogging resources from HSF that could be sent for refugees or anything like this."_ talked Jiminy

_"Talked with Andrew, and this will be all_ pro bono. _Besides, some of the most exclusive costumes he does for capes all around are replicated by cosplayers, and maybe you can be a spearhead for a new product line for cosplayers that want the best. Obviously not so complete: cosplayers doesn't have to deal with supervillains on regular basis. Let us think on darker, velvety colors. This could emphasis the hair and face, and add on the mystery. Otherwise, I believe we can start on your basic design, a Victorian suit, and go from this. Andrew has already some designs, let us see if there's something you like."_ said The Harlequin, while Andrew came with a small binder.

Jiminy knew that Andrew was the Gianni Versacce for capes: only the _creme-de-la-creme_ had access for his designs. So, he thought, Disney would already know about him and partner.

_"I believe that Andrew worked with Disney in the past, for some redesing on the Disney Park princess' design. And looks like they asked also for a more casual redesign for Mickey, but this is all under nondisclosure agreements."_ said The Harlequin, nonchalantly, like it was just a small fact _"Let us see..."_

Jiminy saw design after design, until Sugarplum looked for Jiminy:

_"This one looks promising, right?"_ she asked

It was a dark green tails, with some engravings and embroidements on a kind of rusty gold thread. The waistcoat was on a light, leathery brown, with the same embroidments. The hat was a little like a Mad Hatter, smaller in the brim than in the top, in the same dark green. Pants on a lighter tone of green that gone into a pair of leathery boots. The shirt bellow was simple white, and there was a scarve cravat on a little "dirty" yellow, with some brown shades. The gloves were pure white and there was also a belt in rusty gold...

_"Like this one..."_ looked Jiminy. _"Only the mask I have some issues. I don't think this would be good: this kind of mask sound too villainy for me... No offense, Quin."_ said Jiminy

_"Appology accepted."_ said The Harlequin, that normally uses the Domino Mask. _"We can include a half-mask option."_ she said, turning the page and showing the half-mask and some extra accessories.

_"For you to use on daily basis, as you need to do some maintenance on the helicopters and so, Andrew thought on this faux leather apron. This is very steampunk, even more with the cricked shaped pilot goggles that are a third option for your eyes. The clothes are all on the best fabrics, silk and satin shirts and good boots, like those used by riders."_ said The Harlequin

Jiminy smiled 

_"I like this one: is not too much out from what I'm used to, but is cool."_ said Jiminy

_"Alright: I think we can do this until you need to get back ORSL 1 after the common exercises. Andrew will also ready some more formal costumes, with black pants and tails and rusty yellow waistcoat."_ said The Harlequin, closing the binder _"And I think that someone that saved Christmas needs the best."_

_"How you know..."_

_"I've said before."_ retorted smiling The Harlequin _"If you hear the gossip on the right places, you can infere more things than you can imagine."_

_"And this gossip had come from a certain asset from NORAD?"_ smirked Jiminy

_"You didn't heard that from those lips."_ said The Harlequin, and they all smiled a little: she knew how to do the gossip game, in fact she was a mistress on this one. _"Now... What about some lunch before the exercises?"_ said The Harlequin.
