# Jiminy Cricket - The Sea Support Line

## Chapter 1

> _"Today European Union announced its new strategy to deal with the refugee issues. Called_ Oversea Refugees' Support Line (ORSL), _it will be formed by bases build on decommissioned oil platforms in the middle of Mediterranean Sea. Those bases will be commissioned by transnational specialized NGOs personnel to triage and help people to get into Europe with everything ready to get into asylum status at European countries._
> 
> _The initiative, however, hadn't passed out without critics: some far-right politicians said it was a shame to deploy NGOs that 'certainly will open Europe for the terrorism and globalism', while some far-left said the 'ORSL plan is to send people back Africa without even a bread's morsel'."_

_"Alright, Altayr, gave those cables to Andre connect them to the antennae."_ said the somewhat chubby boy, passing some cables through a small hole in the platform.

_"Roger, Joshua."_ said the Tunisian boy, flying outside the platform, some meters over the sea. That was easy  for the former refugee, as he was an Atlas breakthrough, someone with the traditional super-heroic powers as people thought on them before The Event: flying, super-senses and superstrenght. In fact, Altayr chose his _capename_ Djanni based on the strong Djinn from the Arabic mythos. Joshua, otherwise, was a Mastermind, with more mind-enhancing and will-bending powers. His _Pretty Please!_ power could call people conscience and heart, making them doing what he wanted. Because of this, and as a Disney fan, he chose himself the capename _Jiminy Cricket_.

Albeit they both are underage, they were capes for _Herós Sans Frontières_, and so they were sent to help implementing the ORSL solution.

_"I still don't know why all this."_ said Eileen via Earbug, his friend, while double checking some cargo deployed by helicopter. _"Why not just leave this for Sea Patrol? After all, is their work."_ she said, while doing some of her magic to levitate the cargo crates from the helicopter to the platform ground. As Joshua and Altayr, Eileen was also a Cape, in her case a Merlin, someone that controls magical powers. She could fly and shrink into a little _Tinkerbell_-like form, but she chose to stay into a bigger size where she could work better her magic, as many of this equipment was sensible. As a ballerina that turned into a cape during a _Nutcracker_ presentation, Eileen took as capename the character she was performing at the time, _Sugarplum_.

_"The idea behind ORSL is to provide a kind of safe haven for people that are trying to get into Europe as refugees and, at the same time, provides a place from where troops could be deployed to fight pirates and other scum that attacks on the Mediterranean."_ said the dandy nearby her, that was using a torch to oxy-weld some new antennae over the control room. Even on the hot and humid Mediterranean weather, Andre for sure would wear the same outfit of his personal hero and heroic namesake, Alberto Santos _Dumont_: formals with black tie and trousers, starched shirt and the iconic fedora hat, now added with a leather apron and gloves for the weld working, his steampunk goggles turned black to avoid the worse from the oxy-weld hurtful lightning. Albeit a Verne, a kind of super-science hero, he was not like _Iron Man_, his super-tech all _steampunk_ based and themed: lots of brass and steam and so could be saw everywhere. But even with all this, his super-tech was still _super_: the oxy-weld he was using was small as big beer can, but powerful enough to cut and weld big steel plates, like the one from the control room.

_"So,"_ said Eileen _"we're being used as a kind of border police for European countries? This sounds_ so _fishy!"_

_"I agree."_ said the Japanese men, on a blue overall suit, white baseball cap and a pair of old-fashioned 80s mirror-shades. In his right arm, a big clock-like device could be seen. Seiji was a policeman from _Keichisou_, the Tokyo police, until he undergone a strenuous test and training to be a kind of after Event new police force: the so-called _Twenty-First Century Police Force_, capename _Soldaire_. Doning his Vernetech SolArmor, he could be as fast and strong as an A-Class Ajax, and could also use all kind of tactical support provided by a computer system on it, all the intel being shown on a HUD in his helmet. 

However, he couldn't use it all the time: using the SolArmor was really strenuous for the body, having a time limit to be used before health risk. And albeit this time limit being long enough, it would be better for them that Seiji doesn't used the SolArmor by now, doing the leadership he normally does. And leaders normally feel when something is not right. _"I don't think this is the only reason they asked_ Herós Sans Frontières _to support the ORSL project. Even giving us the platforms as bases, looks like that, at least, there's some PR on all this. By showing the pubic that there will be breakthroughs here, specially those from HSF, they could avoid any PR backlash by deploying troops on the other platforms from the ORSL."_

_"So, the_ cabróns _from the local government are not at all on this support to refugees thing."_ said a man with a yellow and black mask that remembered a lot a stylished face of a badger. Juan, normally called by his capename _Hufflepuff_, was taking some of the big crates and unloading them, specially those from UNHCR, as their payload were heavier. _"They are pushing things on us, and if everything goes okay, they take the profits. And if everything goes to the dogs, we'll be the ones to be blamed."_ while taking one of the crates. As a _Luchador_, he was almost as strong than an Ajax, but slimmer, leaner and more agile than one. And there was the _Kayfabe_, or, as Hufflepuff calls, _La Passion por La Lucha_, the kind of feeling that pump up their powers. Boastful, Hufflepuff have anyway a good smile for kids and so. It was very rare to see Hufflepuff without his mask, though: some says that a _Luchador_ who loses his mask lose his powers with it, at least temporally.

_"That's what I fear"_ said Seiji, while checking some of the hardware before people install it. _"But this will not happen if I can do something on it. At least, not in my watch."_ 

_"We need to think on our own job."_ said the other guy helping to unload the crates from the helicopters. Irish looking, red haired, and too much freckled for his age, Richard 'Ric' McInroy, capename _LionHeart_, was now part of the fixed roster for the _Herós Sans Frontières_. But, until some years before, he was a convicted guy transfered to the HSF, as previously known as _The Bronx Shoulder_, an Ajax that gave too much problems for NY Police. As an Ajax, he was super-strong and super-tough. But he had some smiling face for his friends and for kids. The only thing that could denounce him as a convicted under parole was the small bump behind his neck, where was  implanted a small Vernetech chip device that generated a small signal that could be traced if he tried to get away from his parole, as if. _"No matter what the_ Big Kahunas _thinks, we should just do our job nice and smooth, and the rest can just go to Hell."_ he said, while placing the crates into a elevator, to be deployed at the warehouse.

_"Let us forget all this. There's lots of work to be done and supplies to be brought. And the distance from mainland is enough to tire even our best Atlases. Even Kuntur could not bring all we need from the mainland, crossing half the Mediterranean."_ said other of the team guys. Kabba Bangura, callname _Cabby_, is a Paragon, someone that had gone almost as perfect a human being can be without superpowers. In fact, Kabba can drive or pilot anything that has a motor. Kabba was transfered from _Roque Santeiro_ refugee camp, where Jiminy's team were, to the team as a reinforcement after the ORSL project HSF agreement. With him, came also other three reinforcements: Dr. Lesley Dimantas (capename _Squirrel Girl_), Robert 'Bob' Nsele (capename _Panther_) and Josephine 'Josie' Nondaba (capename _Kilimanjaro_). With another Paragon, Leon Leclerc (capename _Cajun_), and the Bolivian Atlas Jose Marti Poma (capename _Kuntur_), they were the team deployed by HSF at ORSL 1, the first of the ORSL bases, into a decommissioned oil platform.

_"Alright."_ said Andre, finishing the antennae welding and plugging the cables Altayr passed him. _"Joshua, turn the comms on."_ said him via Earbug

_"Roger."_ said Joshua, turning on some keys and hitting some commands into a keyboard at the communication room. After setting some knobs, he took the radio mic and said. "Herós Sans Frontières BP1, _here is ORSL 1, QRA Jiminy Cricket, QSL H5F1Q, QSS 402.005. Basic deploying on schedule, emergency deploy for recommission done. QSL? Copy!"_

_"QSL, Jiminy Cricket. BP1 here. QRA Geppeto, QSL H5F1J, QSS 405.230. QLB 5 by 5. We're on you ORSL 1. Copy."_ said the other side of the talk. QRA Geppeto was the radio-amateur callnames his father took. As Joshua was _Jiminy Cricket_, his parents took callnames based on _Pinocchio_, his father being Geppeto and his mother being _Figaro_, the black cat owned by Geppeto (and after that, by Minnie Mouse).

_"Copy. We'll get back Italy for resupplying before everything is ready. We'll give news as soon we finish recommission the platform. Over."_ said Jiminy, finishing the connection.

_"I don't know why you're still using this radio crap, Jiminy. Quantum-Links are_ way better _than that."_ pouting the little fairy "in front" of Joshua. And the weirdest thing is: normally only him could see her.

Capename _Blue Fairy_ was a weird adding for the team roster. Some weeks before, Joshua was kidnapped by a really bad guy called _Alsyf Alayat_, the Sword Verses. A Mastermind like Joshua, he was instead trying to raise an army against _Roque Santeiro_ people, calling them _Zindiq_, heretics, or _Kafir_, infidels. He would be killed if it wasn't the intervention of _Teatime Anarchist_, the one who people believed was THE Super-Villain. In fact, he was doing what he could to avoid a dictatorship and totalitarian state rise in US and that could grew all around the world, and he tried to push things to avoid this agenda, against his evil quantum twin called Dark Anarchist.

And Joshua was part of this, his death potentially bringing problems for T.A.'s agenda. To avoid it, T.A. gave Joshua a _bioseed_, a special 22nd Century Vernetech device that "seeded" his mind with a Quantum Link to a 22nd century computer. In this computer there was the quantum mirrored personality of a girl that killed herself, jumping to death while origin chasing. Shelly Boyar was her name, and _Blue Fairy_ was the third "active" copy of her personality. One of the other works for _Chicago Sentinels_ as the "remote operator" for the Gynoid _Galathea_ built by Vulcan, and the other acts into the Ouroboros Project, part of Kahle Conspiracy, as  Shelly Boyar, "resurrected" thanks to Ozma's Wish Pills, based on a wish done by Astra.

As a Quantum Ghost, normally Blue Fairy could only talk and be seen by Joshua, but by "downloading" her temporally into some special Vernetech devices she could interact with others.

_"You know that this radio can operate into a triple-failure circuit: it even has a small battery that can power it under the direst situations so we can ask for help. Besides, calling help via Quantum Link would be a problem, as there's only three other people we could ask for help using it: Astra, Shelly and Shell. And this could be a problem into a real time action."_ said Jiminy, after finishing the basic communications setup, while getting out to the main level in the platform. 

_"I know, you boring kid."_ said her, putting her tongue out _"But, where are you going now?"_ said her.

_"I'll go with Cabby back the mainland. Me, him and Altayr."_ said Joshua _"We'll take more supplies to bring back, mainly food and other basics. And I'll copilot the helicopter."_

_"What?"_ said Blue Fairy _"Who had that idea?"_ 

_"Seiji."_ said Joshua, shrugging _"As a Mastermind, my powers are not too much combat focused. So, he thinks that I should train on all things for supporting the team: piloting helis and boats, radio operation, electronics... So, I'm training to take my heli pilot brief. Cabby is training me. And, need to say, with the Mastermind powers, this is easy peasy."_

_"Cheesy!"_ said Blue Fairy, while he sat at the copilot _"But I understand."_

_"Alright."_ said Kabba _"Ready for the next lesson? Now you'll take this off. I saw your training into the simulator, and you did well, but now is real life. Remember: there's at least 200 meters until the sea, and a crash would not be good at all."_

_"Right."_ said Joshua, gulping a little. He now is more accomplished with stressful situations, but he still doesn't like them. So, he thought a little _"Blue Fairy, don't talk to me until I take this off, unless things goes dangerous, okay? Need to concentrate myself on this."_

_"Roger!"_ said Blue Fairy, before getting out of his sight into a POOF! of virtual pixie dust.

Joshua put the headset over his ears and started the procedure. 

_"Turning on pumps... Fuel and Oil pressure okay. Turning on the turbine and the engine. Activating Gas Producer, NG getting up... Temperature operational... Engaging power, raising NG... Propellers on operational rotation... Lift off!"_ said Joshua, reciting each step like a kid doing the A-B-C.

The helicopter start to get out of the helipoint and started to get away from the platform, until all Joshua could see only the waves of the Mediterranean Sea below them.

_"Good work, Joshua. Need only to double-check some things during the takeoff, but you did well... Think you can go till Malta?"_ said Kabba

_"I think so."_ said Joshua

_"Okay. I'll observe you doing the piloting and, if there's any problem, I'll take over command, alright?"_ said Kabba _"Let's go!"_

And this way Joshua had gone until Malta, to take some extra cargo for their new home, the ORSL 1.

## Chapter 2

> _"To be fair, the ORSL 1 base was a weird place to live: an old decommissioned oil platform, we took at least one week to do all the main job to make it habitable again. It was smelly and moldy, and it was difficult to put everything nice again, but some time after, we are almost as good there as at Geneva or_ Roque Santeiro. _And the Vernetech Dumont put on it make things even better: we grown the base for our use until we could even get below the sea! Even seeing the fish!"_
>
> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

As the base was not that big, it was like being back _Roque Santeiro_'s Barracks. In his quarters, Joshua lived with Altayr, Eileen and Lesley.

It was when the sun rose and they could see the sea. Joshua yawned and looked through the window to see the seagulls and waves.

_"Alright, Joshua!"_ said Blue Fairy, showing into his sight dressed on pyjamas, even a sleeping cap over her virtual hair _"Rise and shine."_ she said, while everyone woke up.

_"Okay."_ said Joshua, yawning. _"And now?"_

_"Now, for shower. And don't be a whining kid: Altayr is already woken up."_ said Blue Fairy

_"Altayr is doing the_ Fajr _praying, he should be."_ said Joshua, looking for Altayr, his mattress pointed to an specific direction and him doing, silently and discreetly, the first of the five prayings of the _Salat_, the Muslim mandatory prayings. He got to the bathroom and took a shower while Altayr was finishing the prayer. As soon he got out, Altayr finished his prayer and Eileen and Lesley had woke up.

_"Alright, Joshua."_ said Altayr _"School today?"_

_"Only afternoon."_ said Joshua _"I'll have some breakfast and then I'll need to go for some supplies with Cabby. I need to take hours piloting to get my pilot brief. After getting back, I'll have school and then some extra lessons for my radio operation license by Dumont. And you?"_

_"School now, then patrol with Kuntur and Dumont and fighting training with Kuntur, Cajun and Hufflepuff. And Qu'ran studies with my father and some_ Imam _from England."_ said Altayr.

_"And you Eileen?"_ asked Joshua, while he saw her getting back from the shower while Lesley gone to it.

_"I'll work at my final essay for the post-grad now, and then work with Lesley on some triaging of some of the refugees we rescued yesterday and then some Arabic class."_ said Eileen.

_"And I'll work all day, and tonight I'll read some of the new papers on breakthrough and refugees psychology."_ said Lesley.

_"Okay... Think everyone will have a full day."_ said Joshua, a little down _"Sometimes I miss the_ Roque Santeiro _time, when we did everything together."_

_"It's temporary, sport."_ said Eileen _"We're all working hard to recommission ORSL 1, and all the ORSL project. As soon things goes calmer, we'll have shifts and so and then we can work back together."_

_"Alright."_ sighed Joshua, while dressing into his Jiminy Cricket costume, the simpler one, without the weapons and armor from his flying costume _Iron Cricket_. After put the costume, aside the hat and mask, he gone for a breakfast at the cafeteria, where the cater was all by LionHeart. Today he did pancakes and some bread and egg, coffee and milk and so. They all ate together and talked a little before each other going for their work.

Cabby was on his "costume", so to speak: a military fatigue, with a straitjacket and a belt with two pistols, a dog-tag over his neck with some Leonean charms. He was checking some of the things at a big helicopter into a kind of parking lot, just some below the platform top level.

_"Hey, Kabba."_ said Joshua.

_"Now, kiddo. I know this is just a simple thing, but a mission is a mission, so let us do this fair and square. Alright, Jiminy Cricket?"_ said Kabba, smiling

_"Oh! Right, Cabby!"_ said Joshua, or better, Jiminy.

_"Alright. Today we'll bring two provision crates. So we'll need to use one of the big helis. We'll take the Mi-26T2."_ said Cabby and Jiminy gasped.

In his training, since he came to ORSL, he was flying as much he could and also training in the simulator, but he only had flown small helicopters, like the _AS355-NP Écureuil 2_, nicknamed _Twin Squirrel_, and so. The Mi-26T2 was the biggest helicopter all the world, and even with Atlases all around, this helicopter was still useful, because his speed, cargo capacity and so. 

_"Any problem?"_ said Cabby.

_"No... I think I can copilot."_ said Jiminy.

_"In fact, I want you to be the pilot."_ and that made Jiminy gasping even more _"I did the pre-flying check and I'm just waiting the heli to be fueled. I have the flight plan here."_ said Cabby, showing Jiminy a small clipboard with a flight plan, that Jiminy just skimmed very fast, understanding it fast thanks to his breakthrough-powered mind.

_"Okay."_ said Jiminy breathing heavily to calm down from the pressure he was feeling.

_"Jiminy, I know you didn't flown the Mi-26T2, even in the simulator, but we need to take the last supplies soon: there's a weather report for strong storms coming, and we need to be ready. Some the supplies we are bringing are vernetech materials Dumont need for reinforce the ORSL 1 enough to support the weather changing here at the Mediterranean. The plan is go straight to Italian HSF base at Siracusa, take a time while the cargo are loaded and the heli refueled and then straight back. Maybe you'll be late for school today, but hope there's not too much time lost. However, the weather can change very fast and we could need to take a detour or even landing at Malta for a time. And this is not the only problem: we had a report of sky pirates in the region. Dumont had adapted our heli so we just need one pilot and the other could take a .50 machine gun the deployed. Hope things are easy and we don't need them, anyway."_ said Cabby

Sky pirates: people that undergone breakthroughs with flying powers and gone rogue, or people that bought vernetech ways to fly and use them to rob airships and their cargo. They are a bigger menace on the Chinese States, but in the Mediterranean they are also a pesky nuisance. Djanni and Kuntur had already fought some, but they defeated them easily. All the contact with them that Jiminy had, however, was via intel and After-Action Reports he read or written.

_"Alright. We'll have any support into an emergency?"_ said Jiminy

_"I believe so, we can ask for help. We are not to engage into combat, understood?"_ said Cabby, while they were getting into the big helicopter. A parking system took the helicopter from his place below the platform top and lifting it, while Jiminy did the starting procedure, double checking each pass while the big turbines and rotors were activated. So, as soon they got outside, they were ready for takeoff. Jiminy pushed the control lever, while pulling the power lever, so the power could be applied under the rotor and turbines, and the helicopter got away easily.

_"Nice smooth takeoff, Jiminy. I little bumpy, but good for a first time."_ said Cabby. His "power", so to speak, as a Paragon, was his driving and piloting skills: as far a thing had a engine and wheel or lever, he could pilot it easily. _"Now, let us follow the plan as I did, right?"_ 

_"Right..."_ said Jiminy _"Blue Fairy, could you help me?"_ 

_"Oh, captain, my captain."_ said Blue Fairy, showing herself on a kind of Navy uniform.

_"When Cabby says next destination, could you plot a line into my line of sight?"_ he said.

_"Sure. Easy peasy!"_ said her.

_"Now, Jiminy, 400 knots NNE to our next reference."_ said Cabby, and Blue Fairy heard it also via the quantum link she have with Jiminy's brain and sensorial neural circuits. 

_"Route traced."_ said Blue Fairy.

_"Called your little cyberpixie helper?"_ said Cabby, and Jiminy nodded _"This is very useful, but try to focus on the real instruments."_

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy, looking for the instruments.

_"Cheapskate!"_ said Blue Fairy, putting her tongue out for Cabby, but only Jiminy could see, as she wasn't downloaded on some visual device, and so she only appeared into Jiminy's visual field as an image the Quantum Link produced into his brain.

_"Blue Fairy, Cabby is right: but also a help is always welcomed."_ said Jiminy, looking to adjust the helicopter, until the compass would be in the correct place and the line Blue Fairy did was straight in front.

_"Nice. Now... It'll take at least one hour on this. Lock the autopilot and maybe you can take your French lesson."_ said Cabby smiling, while Jiminy hitted a button in the panel and started with another to hear the French lesson.

---

The flight was a good one and the weather helped, so in somewhat two and a half hours they were at HSF base at Siracusa, and they took a meal while the Mi-26T2 was refueled and the supplies loaded to full cargo hold.

_"The flight back home will be slower, because all our cargo."_ said Cabby, hitting some keys on an epad where he was doing the flight plan back ORSL 1 _"And looks there's a chance we take a big rain in our way back ORSL 1. The Mediterranean weather is a mess, need to say."_

_"Maybe we should ready some alternate routes."_ said Jiminy, that took away his tails for a moment, as Siracusa was very hot. _"This could help."_ he said, taking a sip of his cold milkshake.

_"I'll put some alternate routes, so be ready to take action if needed. I think you can do well with your_ Bellax Analytica _and with Blue Fairy help."_, said Cabby, looking for the small holoprojector Jiminy had placed over the table, while they rested and he did some class on Chemistry.

Blue Fairy was "downloaded" into it: this way, she could be seen by everyone and talk straight directly with them, as if she was a kind of cybernetic pixie. All that Jiminy needed to do is to touch a device time enough to her do the job of "downloading" herself into it. She didn't need Jiminy to touch the device again to be "uploaded" back Jiminy's mind: this was taken by granted by the Quantum Link system that was the base on everything Blue Fairy.

_"Now you want my help? You cheater!"_ said Blue Fairy, smiling, to Cabby _"But it's okay."_

_"Okay."_ a guy using green overalls with HSF logo on it said _"The cargo had been loaded on your helicopter and it was refueled. I think this is the last cargo for the ORSL 1 recommission. We'll talk with Geneva and ORSL 1 for  more stable schedules for ORSL 1 resupplies. And I think that this kid can help us, if he was good enough to pilot a helicopter this big by himself."_ said the man, looking with a smile for Jiminy, that was not too much a kid anymore. Being now twelve, he grew a lot and lost some of the childish chubbiness, but now he was a little gangly on the walk, and he was still using his costume like something straight from _Disney Magic_ racks.

_"Alright."_ said Cabby, while he and Jiminy finished their refreshments and get into the helicopter. They could saw, while sitting in the pilot and copilot spaces, that the cargo was put into the helicopter: some big crates full of supplies.

_"The voyage back will be slow."_ said Cabby, looking back  _"We are too much heavy, most of our power only being used to push everything. And there's a chance of storm in the way."_ 

_"I think I can deal with this if you need."_ said Jiminy

_"Sounds sensible. Better you use_ Bellax Analytica _all the way: heard some nasty gossip about sky pirates. The flight plan was done to avoid as much as possible the bad weather, but maybe we should think on the issue: IMHO, between sky pirates and a storm, I go for a storm any day."_ said Cabby, while they started the power-on and liftoff procedure, Cabby and Jiminy hitting buttons and pushing levers and seeing the instruments until the big helicopter got out the ground and they gone to the Mediterranean Sea.

The first hour was okay, even both of them trying to not talk too much: the weather computer, receiving information from the same system airplanes uses real-time, was showing the storm just tangentially in the route Cabby traced and inputted into the flight computer system. 

It was when Jiminy felt the same weird tingling when his _Bellax Analytica_ engaged, when he foresaw something creepy:

_"Cabby, sounds like we'll have company soon. I know the radar doesn't show anything, but..."_ said Jiminy.

_"I understand."_ said Cabby _"Hope you're wrong, but better safe than sorry: which side? or both?"_ said Cabby

_"Looks like they'll go port side. They are coming from someplace from Tunisia or Algeria."_ said Jiminy.

_"Okay... I'll take one of the turrets. Stay on pilot. If we have a situation, as soon I need to open fire, call ORSL 1: certainly someone ready for action there."_ said Cabby, pulling a little VR helmet-like device: a vernetech deployed on the heli by Dumont, when engaged turned the lever on copilot (Cabby's) seat a control for one of the twin .50 turrets put as a defense system below it. There wasn't too much ammo, just less than 100 rounds of bullets each: the idea was just buy time until the cavalry arrive.

_"You're right Jiminy, they are coming, I don't even need the radar. I have them on visual, somewhat 10 knots from us."_ said Cabby

_"Changing route through the storm!"_ said Jiminy _"Blue Fairy, trace me the route: 10 hours, 440 knots."_

_"Roger!"_ said Blue Fairy, showing him the line. _"Hope this one is not a nasty one."_

_"Sounds like."_ said Jiminy, seeing the black clouds and the blur made by the rain _"I'm rerouting the heli to just get into the storm enough to make them lost our scent."_ said Jiminy, when he felt the first impacts of bullets hitting the heli.

_"There's ten of them: at least four of them fliers by themselves, at least one of them a B-Class electrokinectic, the others two C-Classes Atlases and an C-Class aerokinetic. The non-fliers are using 'commonplace' Vernetech ornithopters. Heavy weapons: they think we have Ajaxes or Atlases here."_ said Jiminy, when he hit the comm button for ORSL 1 frequency. _"ORSL 1, Transport 2, Jiminy Cricket here. We have tangos on our port side, less than five knots. We're under attack and request help."_

_"Here's ORSL 1. Soldaire here. Sugarplum and Kilimanjaro are a go! Hold the transponder engaged no matter what. Djanni and Kuntur are a go ASAP. Hold your situation."_ said Soldaire, while Jiminy could hear the BUDDHA-BUDDHA-BUDDHA from the turret

_"Cabby, are you safe?"_ said Jiminy 

_"I can held myself, if you need to push on."_ said Cabby.

_"I'll try to gain some speed."_ said Jiminy, focusing his _Bellax Analytica_ on the helicopter flying and pulling the speed lever as far he could.

_"Jiminy, take care, don't push too much!"_ said Cabby.

_"I'll do!"_, said Jiminy, leaving the hand as soon the speed was okay, when he gasped!

_"Cabby, be ready for a Charlie Foxtrot!"_ said Jiminy 

_"What?"_

_"They'll try to flank us! Some of them were flying low and now they are coming from the star side!"_

_"What the..."_ said Cabby, when they felt a strong hit, the heli shaking a little, Jiminy didn't believe he held the control.

_"RPG!"_ said Jiminy, holding the control lever like he was riding a wild horse in a rodeo _"We didn't lost a shaft by luck, as it didn't hit us straight, exploding in the air thankfully, but we were hit just by the shockwave, very luckily."_

_"We should not take this for granted!"_ said Cabby, controlling the turret. _"I don't think I can hold them too much. Be ready for a crash landing if needed: better alive than dead. Take us out of the storm it would be safe."_

_"Right!"_ said Jiminy, pushing the lever to get away from the storm, losing the cover.

_"Alright... I'll make them pay dearly to blown us!"_ said Cabby.

The combat was intense, and even Cabby making two of them fall in the sea, they were hitting the heli hard. 

_"C'mon Sugarplum, where are you?"_ said Jiminy, trying to not follow the ways where his _Bellax Analytica_ showed the helicopter down and/or each of them being shot strong by the pirates, but even with his training he was starting to despair, and even Blue Fairy tips on what to do are doing little to avoid this.

_"Jiminy, the cavalry had come!"_ said Blue Fairy, when he saw two bolts of energy crossing the sides of the heli, hitting some of the attacking forces.

He could see Sugarplum, that was not on Tink mode, but into on a cloud blue costume, pointing the wand to the tangos Jiminy could see below him. He could hear a strong BOOM, like the air was pressurized below them, and he could feel the aftershock sent by Sugarplum attacks.

_"Jiminy, go! We can stop them."_ said Sugarplum via radio

_"No way! We'll help."_ said Jiminy, pushing the engine lever to a halt position, making the helicopter stops all of nothing.

_"Hey, Jiminy! Be calmer next time!"_ said Cabby, while Jiminy hit the autopilot to ensure the helicopter would stay on position.

He could see the lighting bolts getting from Kilimanjaro's hands. A very impressive woman, she left her tribe, the Nondabas, that she should be leading as successor after her mother and grandmother, Mabinty and Masseray, passed away during an attack by the _Undying Caliphate_ some months before. But the people from her tribe disbanded, joining other tribes, and she had now responsibility for only two people, the brothers Sawie and Senesie, the last one a B-Class Merlin Jiminy and the others helped to avoid goes crazy during a drug induced psychotic breakthrough and was now living in ORSL 1.

_"No, Cabby. They brought us the Foxtrot, now they'll dance!"_ said Jiminy, taking his hand to the same VR device Cabby was using.

_"No, Jiminy, Cabby is right!"_ said Blue Fairy. _"Let me do this: I can engage the VR system, just touch it time enough I can configure myself!"_ said her _"Focus on take all of us out of this and back ORSL 1!"_ 

_"Alright."_ said him, sighing, while just touching some of the contacts on it.

He knew the weird feel when he "downloaded" Blue Fairy on other devices. Normally, he could "download" her to any device with wireless connections to let her go loose. But the helicopter was all wired and shielded, so he needed to do this via some device. He just waited time enough until he hear her voice via radio, like she was somewhere else.

_"Alright. Deployed! Let's go!"_ said Blue Fairy, when he felt the other turret being engaged.

Jiminy pushed the hand back to the handle and disengaged the autopilot, pushing the helicopter back front, while he could see Kilimanjaro and Sugarplum doing some shots against the sky pirates, and he could see Kuntur and Djanni going to join Sugarplum and Kilimanjaro.

_"We should slow a little..."_ said Jiminy

_"No, this will only ease things for the tangos."_ said Cabby _"Trust on them, they know the drill..."_

_"Maybe I should too..."_ said Jiminy meekly.

_"They trust you know your drill."_ said Cabby smiling, below the VR headset _"Make their trust worthy, and trust them."_

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy, when he heard Djanni saying something on the radio

_"Jiminy, open the cargo bay. The tangos are down or flew away."_ he said

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy, hitting a button while the cargo door was opened, and they entered the helicopter on flying. _"Let us get back ORSL 1."_

---

Everyone could see Jiminy was uneasy while he was doing the After Action Report: he was almost the clerk of the team, and for him doing this was like breathing after all the time at _Herós Sans Frontières_.

_"Bees on your bucket, short stuff?"_ said Sugarplum, looking for him, in the small desk at his bedroom where he was doing the After-Action Report.

_"I'm not so short anymore, you know."_ said Jiminy, albeit being the shortest of the team, even Djanni being bigger than him. _"I'm pissed off on being treated like a kid in field."_

Sugarplum looked to him.

_"Look: first of all, you need to understand that your powers are_ **NOT FOR COMBAT AT ALL**. _All times you engaged combat, you were defeated or needed to be saved somehow or had gone very hurt."_ she said _"I know you want to be useful on field, and you are more than you think."_

_"I'm not so useful..."_ said Jiminy

_"I know what are you thinking on. You're still thinking on the events from your last time at Newark."_ said Sugarplum.

Last time (at all, if you ask Jiminy and his family) he got back his birth city, Newark, he was asked to give an anti-origin-chasing talk for his former school colleagues. He then was attacked after the speech by some of the bullies that almost killed him, making him passing through breakthrough. They also undergone breakthrough during a riot at the youth detention center, and Jiminy had to fight them to avoid civilian casualties. They came to 'tag' him and get a kill on for them as a way to build a fame as Super-villain. He was very injured and, even dropping one of them and convinced the other to help him, he was almost killed. In the process they damaged the school foundations, making it go down, and just the help of Presto, the one of them that defected to help Jiminy, avoided lots of fatalities.

But more than the body injury (reduced for some scars from leaf-made cuts), the worst ones were the injuries in his mind: he could deal with being almost killed by a very powerful super-villain as _Alsyf Alayat_, the Sword Verses. He still could not cope being almost killed by someone his own age.

_"Not just this... Looks like all time I get into combat, I got injured."_ said Jiminy, frustrated.

_"I know."_ said Sugarplum _"I can't say this will be easy for you to deal with, but you need to remember..."_ she said, doing the _Rock-Paper-Scissors_ gesture.

_"If you're scissors,"_ said Sugarplum, doing the scissors gesture _"you need to fight paper, not scissors or rock."_ she complemented, doing the gestures with her pretty hands _"Fighting scissors is difficult, as you did when you fought_ Alsyf Alayat, _as your powers as similar and so difficult to fight each other. But fight rock is totally impossible: he'll almost certainly break you 100% of the times. I understand that you felt yourself useless on that time at Newark. But, in fact, you weren't: you gained time and survived, and even saved_ Presto _from get into the same fate of the others, to go for Detroit SuperMax, after he helped you saving the people in the school."_

Presto was one of your attackers: a B-Class Merlin, his powers were based on invoking and using powers from _Dungeons & Dragons_ game. And, Jiminy looked after, it was a big source of creepypasta if brought to real life. Now he was under a parole back to Hillwood Academy, while the others are in a prison for super-villains. The fact he helped to save people was put into accord to allow him get back Hillwood instead going for a Juvenile ward at Detroit SuperMax.

_"I know you had no option beside fighting: they came looking for you, and you felt that you could be dead. But now... You're with us. You're our scissors. You can't win just with scissors, but we can't win just with paper and/or rock. You need to find the best combination."_ said Sugarplum, looking for Jiminy: she knew normally he took out his Cricket-shaped half-mask while doing the After Action Report, but now he was on it, and she knew why.

He was crying.

_"I just..."_ said Jiminy, sobbing, tears starting to form in his eyes.

_"I know... You want to be useful. Cabby said me what happened, and I know that he and Soldaire retorted you when you got back ORSL 1."_ said Sugarplum, holding his hands. _"But look: you need to understand that Cajun, Soldaire and so, when teach you on combat skills, they do this to ensure you can_ survive _a situation, not_ win it. _Your powers are more useful when helping others to extract the 110% of what they could do._ This _is the scissors, this is your power. None of us can win alone, and I need to say fortunately: if you ask me, as soon you think you can solve all kind of situations all by yourself, you're just a itty bitty tad to go super-villain."_

Jiminy took his mask, and Sugarplum took a little handkerchief from a pocket from under her tutu and petticoats and passed it to Jiminy.

_"Sorry... I... I just don't know..."_ said Jiminy, while using the handkerchief to dry his tears.

_"It's okay: you had a lot in those times. You're still a kid, and you want to prove yourself, even more that you're growing into a teenager, so you felt frustrated when I showed you your limitations. But this is part of being adult: to know that (a) you're not self-resilient and (b) you're not alone."_ said Sugarplum.

_"Thanks, Su... Eileen."_ said Jiminy, somewhat breaking a kind of cape social protocol: you normally don't use a cape real name when he's on costume, even if you know it.

_"That's okay, kiddo."_ said Sugarplum, when they heard someone knock the door. It was Dumont

_"Jiminy, Sugarplum, I just finished an important thing, and the supplies you brought, Jiminy, were critical for this. Want to take a look?"_ he said, and Joshua nodded, putting back his mask.

They got until a place where one of the original spars were. Those spars were reinforced with a net made of carbon fiber and graphene nanotubes, made by Dumont and a task-force of Vernes, using the physical structure from the spar as a vine scanders a liana or other trees and structures to hold itself. The original spar was now almost empty space that the same task-force was reinforcing for turn it into useful space, for more accommodations and supply stores. In the one Dumont brought them, there was a elevator, like those from shoppings.

_"Alright, let's go."_ said Dumont, hitting a button, and they felt they were going down... And down... And down...

Until the could see the elevator getting into some water that was in the spar, and then, sometime after, going transparent, when they saw they where under the sea. Jiminy could not avoid go WOW, looking the vibrant sea life all around, with all the fishes and octopuses and mantas and stuff, even some small sharks passing near and there.

_"They can't get in: this is glassluminum, a vernetech alloy, stronger then carbon fiber and graphene, and more foldable. And, even better, transparent and almost without ecological impact. ORSL 1's ecological footprint is very low."_ said Dumont, proudly, when they saw on a side a big block of something like concrete that was connected to a place below them.

It was when, after 3 or 4 minutes on the elevator, they gone somehow 750 meters below the sea line, at the sea bed, and the elevator connected himself to a door. He needed to wait a little, and they could hear some kind of pressure system engaging.

_"Just correcting the pressure to avoid an explosive decompression."_ said Dumont, when the door opened to what looked like a very hi-tech base, that could not be humbled by Chicago Sentinels' Cave. There was still lots of empty space, but the _Star Trek_-like design and all the equipment that was placed on it showed that things were really super-tech, as all Vernetech should look.

_"Sorry not talked about this with you before. This was a classified project from_ Herós Sans Frontières, _part of ORSL project. We call this_ Atlantis." said Dumont, looking for Sugarplum and Jiminy amazed faces.


## Chapter 3

> _"Project Atlantis was a classified project in the time: even I didn't knew all the details from it then. The idea was, via Vernetech, to create a submarine infrastructure in deep waters. The experiment was the basis for other deep water bases used all around the world by CAI teams that needs to work into places with too much ocean nearby, like Fiji, Japan and, obviously, nearby the Mediterranean Sea."_
>
> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

The "official" event for Project Atlantis was small: as a classified project, they could not disclosure the details at the time. But there was some capes and even non-cape officials from UNHCR and HSF, including Jiminy and Djanni's parents. It was incredible for Jiminy that some of the _Chicago Sentinels_ came: Vulcan, the team Verne, was one of the minds behind Project Atlantis with Dumont.

_"As soon people talked about the ORSL project, and EU accepted the recommission of ORSL 1, we implemented Project Atlantis, as an extra base for_ Herós Sans Frontières."  said Vulcan _"Your numbers are really big: at least 150 fixed capes, beside all the volunteers from around the world. Looks like Geneva base was a little cramped, or so Dumont said me."_  he said smiling _"And the idea behind Project Atlantis was also good to look as a way to deal with convicted super-villains. We are into a surge of super-villainy recently, and the recent resurgement of The Ascendant and his breaking into Detroit SuperMax are making us looking for alternatives on how to deal with all the super villains in the system."_

_"And how Project Atlantis could help on all this?"_ asked Jiminy, that was drinking some soda and eating small tuna sandwiches, their parents taking some finger food and wine or sake.

_"You see: deep water and the oceanic Benthic Zones are still a great problem for sea operations, the real Final Frontier. Even with all the resources on the sea mantle, using just 'normal' tech for doing this exploration is not only costly, but very dangerously. And even for breakthroughs, trying to get down the deep waters is risky: by doing it, even A-Classes Ajaxes or Atlases risk their lives, as this level of power can be not enough to cope with the abyssal pressure and the absence of breathable oxygen. There's some Metamorphs that can go this below by turning into fish and other water creatures, but even they need to change in the meantime into some of the abyssal creatures that are able to cope with the pressure and absence of air, and this is also risky, because a failure in the shape-shifting could result into instantaneous death."_ said Vulcan

_"So, by creating something like this Project Atlantis somewhere, you could insulate the worst criminals into a hostile environment."_ said Mr. McCarthy, after eating some sushi _"But, why not doing this on space? The technology for it is somewhat common and already dominated. And with Vernes, we could build space prisons easily and cheaply."_

_"But there's lots of Atlas that could cope with the void vacuum, hold their breath time enough to resist the oxygen absence, deal with the almost zero kelvin temperature, cope with the hellish temperatures and friction in the atmospheric re-entrance and so. And there's a risk component: think on Iron Jack, one of our reserves. If a villain with his powers goes to a space prison, he could just do some impulse and turn himself into a denser material than the prison walls to easily break it away, and this would be bad enough, because the prison could blow because the catastrophic depressurization."_ said Vulcan

_"Then, without friction, he would gain more and more speed, by the acceleration and inertia, and with so he could gain even more momentum and kinetic energy. The denser material would, at least theoretically, allow to him to cope the re-entrance and so. And, if you think that the median human has 110 pounds, and almost all the Metamorphs could change his mass, or at least 90% of it, into another kind of matter, you could have at least a Hiroshima-like explosion, beside the radiation, where he hit the ground, based on all the kinetic energy gathered in the process to be dissipated in the hit. Think this getting into Chicago, New York or San Francisco. It would be a catastrophe for sure. A hit in the sea could create a tsunami big enough to heavily damage coast cities"_ said Vulcan, which made the McCarthys gasp 

_"In the sea, the water could be a really discouragement factor. Bruce Lee was right to see the water as a versatile, strong and deadly element: some megatons of water with lots of pressure is enough to deal with even the worst A-Class villain, even Ultras being somehow manageable. Even considering our hypothetical Iron Jack-turned-evil scenario, the water pressure and mass would hit him pretty hard. He would be not able to resist a re-arrest, even more if there was ways to detect soon, as he would be exhausted with coping with so much punishment the water would deal on him."_

_"And so, water could be a easier way to contain them."_ said Jiminy

_"But where you would deploy this SuperMax?"_ asked Mrs. McCarthy

_"The Project Atlantis is still under a test: this base is the first prototype, built by_ Herós Sans Frontières, Chicago Sentinels, UNHCR _and lots of countries as a prototype. The economic viability is still being put into accord... but we already had some results and it's promising. We are into talks, classified of course, to do this somewhere into international waters in places like the Atlantic or the Ring of Fire. Some studies are even considering explore the Mariana Trench, as it's very deep, 11 thousand meters."_ said Blackstone, that was coming  around, lifting discreetly the hat. As always, he was a kind of dandy, but those who underestimate him because of this normally pay dearly: his stage magic based powers are strong, and he was an US Marine before the Event, a great intel specialist, and one of the last founder members of the _Chicago Sentinels_. And as an extra factor, beside him, he was with Seven, the super-lucky hero. His power was officially the _enhanced serendipity_: almost all time, if he wanted, he got it.

_"How are you, Mr. and Mrs. McCarthy, Jiminy?"_ said Blackstone, smiling

_"We are fine, thank you Blackstone."_ said Jiminy, replying the cumpliment by lifting his hat. With Blackstone, Seven and Vulcan, there was also The Harlequin, discreetly sassy on her party dress; Chakra, into her half Indian half Gypsy clothes, and Astra, that left her big bell-shaped mallet, _Malleus_, behind. _"And thank you for all the help you gave me last year. I think I would be dead now otherwise."_

_"Shelly and Shell are the ones you should be thankful for. And Blue Fairy also, as she was the one who alerted us where you were after all."_ he said _"But you're a good kid after all, and we need more kids like you, as a new generation of capes is coming. And need to say for you, Mr. and Mrs. McCarthy: I liked what I've read in_ 'Superdads'." said Blackstone, looking for a pocket from where he took, by his stage magic, a hardcover copy of the book.

_Superdads: Parenting kids, breakthrough or not_ was the book Jiminy's parents written based on the experiences on raising him, with extra opinions from other breakthrough parents and psychologists and other specialist opinions. It was a _New York Times_ Best-Seller and had raised some money for HSF and awareness on how to deal with breakthrough children. There was the fair share of criticism, sure, but it was okay for Jiminy that lots of people liked it.

Blackstone showed it like he wanted it signed and while Jiminy's parents signed the book for Blackstone, Jiminy's Earbug beeped.

_"I'll left you for just a minute, excuse me."_ said Jiminy, getting a little away, before hitting the Earbug. _"Jiminy here."_

_"Jiminy, Soldaire here: we have some information about a big schooner-like boat in the middle of the sea, nearby Algerian waters. Looks like the kind of people we need to rescue after all, here in ORSL 1. But the weather there is a mess, and there's a chance they sink before any Sea Patrol boats get nearby."_ said Soldaire, that was on duty in the Control Room, so in the Dispatch.

_"Right. Just a minute."_ said Jiminy, looking for his parents and the Sentinels. _"Sorry, I'm on duty today: need to answer Soldaire's call."_

_"It's okay, sweetie."_ said Mrs. McCarthy, kissing him in the cheek, which made Jiminy blush. _"Just do your job fair and square and take care and we'll be okay with this."_

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy, going for the elevator and hitting back the Earbug _"I was talking with Blackstone and my parents, I just could not leave them out of nothing."_

_"It's okay."_ said Soldaire _"The radio comm says they're really overloaded with at least 100 people."_

_"What?"_ said Jiminy, and he looked that Djanni, Kuntur, Sugarplum and Dumont were going too.

_"I already deployed Transport 2 in action with Cabby and Kilimanjaro. They are going first to start the rescue and double-check the weather. You'll go with Transport 1 for support and deploy the rest of team. The plan is simple: we'll send you at the site. Kuntur and Sugarplum will be the ones to rescue anyone in the sea. Djanni and Dumont will take the ones in the boat. Cabby and you will hold the helicopters only high enough so they could used the platforms we built to put everyone in the heli. As soon you finish it, get back: the sea is troubled and they are in the middle of a storm."_ said Soldaire, while they were going back to ORSL 1 via the elevator.

_"Alright. Any tangos or potential ones?"_ said Jiminy

_"AFAIK, no."_ said Soldaire _"Anyway, it's better to act with caution: all the terrorist nuts nearby are trying to take a tag on us and take ORSL 1 as their possession."_

_"Right."_ said Jiminy, getting out the elevator straight to the helicopter.

Transport 1 was a Mi-171A2, a little smaller than the Mi-26T2 he already flown out, but still a big helicopter. 

_"Okay, everyone in the back. I'll pilot and_ Blue Fairy _will help me."_ said Jiminy, getting into the pilot post, activating the basic avionics and radio putting the headset over his head, his hat in the copilot seat. _"Soldaire, Jiminy here in the Transport 1. Starting the liftoff procedure. Need the coordinates for the target."_

_"Sending you."_ said Soldaire, reciting the coordinates, while Blue Fairy, that was in her Navy uniform, hearing it also through her Quantum Link.

_"Right!"_ said Blue Fairy, while Jiminy hitted the coordinates into the flight system _"Tracing Route."_ 

_"OK. Sounds this will be a rough rodeo if the intel is right."_ said Kuntur. _"Jiminy, I think you know the gig."_

_"I know it. And I have_ Blue Fairy _as copilot."_ he said, while touching the headset time enough to "download" her into the helicopter autopilot system. Then he finished the liftoff process 

_"So, take us there."_ , said Sugarplum

_"Alright. ORSL 1, Transport 1 departing!"_ said Jiminy, pushing the levers to liftoff the helicopter.

The helicopter got the right direction and some time after they could see, as a little point in the horizon, Transport 2, the Mi-26T2, being piloted by Cabby.

_"Transport 2, Transport 1 here."_ said Jiminy _"We have you on visual, and can see that the weather is rough. What can you say?"_ said Jiminy

_"Transport 1 here."_ said Cabby in the radio _"It's a rough weather here: storm and big winds. I took Kilimanjaro with me, but even her can't stop the rain enough. So she's doing her weather control to decrease the risks, specially the thunder and strong winds ones."_ 

_"Right."_ said Jiminy, passing forward the information for everyone .

_"Dumont,"_ said Kuntur _"do you still have that Faraday Cage-like jackets you built?"_ 

_"Yup!"_ said Dumont

_"So, we'll dress the refugees on it. Me and Djanni could stand a thunder direct hit, albeit we can got hurt. You and Sugarplum, take care. Kilimanjaro will do her best to hold the weather condition stable enough to be safe, but be alert."_ said Kuntur, pushing some pallets and mounting the caddy to hold the refugees to be brought to the helis.

_"We'll do first to Transport 2 as it is bigger, and so we can ensure more people be rescued."_ said Cabby. _"Then we'll load the Transport 1 and we'll get away together ASAP."_

_"Right!"_ said Jiminy, and they got into the place, just a little below and nearby the Transport 2. _"I'm getting down a little to ease things."_

He was 10 meters above the water, and the sea was really troubled. 

_"I'm opening now. I can't get down anymore: the winds and the waves could hit us and throw us in the sea!"_ said Jiminy, hitting a small button and opening the helicopter back. The winds crashing against the inner walls made Jiminy finch a little while holding the control lever to make the helicopter stable. _"Go go go!"_

The other capes got out: Sugarplum did some charms to avoid everyone and the caddies being wet, while Kuntur and Djanni got down to rescue the refugees.

_"We are from Heroes Without Borders team at ORSL 1 base. Please, evacuate the boat orderly. Women and Children first. Follow the orientations from our capes and we'll rescue you._ Nous sommes des Héros Sans Frontières équipe à la base ORSL 1. S'il vous plaît, évacuer ordonné le bateau. Les femmes et les enfants d'abord. Suivez les orientations de nos caps et nous vous sauverons. nahn min 'abtal bila hudud fi fariq ORSL 1 qaeidatin. min fidlik, 'iikhla' alqarib almunazama. alnisa' wal'atfal 'awla. atabae tawajuhat min alruwuws ladayna, wanahn sawf 'iinqadh lakum." said Jiminy, using the megaphones at the helicopter, and he could see everyone being put with some of Dumont's jackets that worked also as life jackets.

"Blue Fairy, _on radar and comms. Anything weird, say me. I need to concentrate on hold the helicopter attitude. Not too easy with all these winds, and the shafts are not giving all the power thanks the water and low air temp."_ said Jiminy.

_"Aye aye, sir!"_ said Blue Fairy, while Jiminy could see via the camera the first refugees being sent to the Transport 1.

_"Alright, we are okay..."_ said Jiminy. when he felt something tingling on him.

_"Everyone, be ready! Looks like we have some tangos coming."_ said Jiminy, looking for the radar.

_"Alright! Sugarplum, Dumont, hold our position. Jiminy, make Blue Fairy take the turret on Transport 1, I'll take Transport 2's."_ said Cabby.

_"We had already put 40 of them on Transport 2."_ said Djanni. _"One of them talked me they are 90. ETA for the tangos, Jiminy?"_

_"ETA 180 seconds."_ said Jiminy

_"I think we can rescue the last ones before the tangos came. Hurry up, Kuntur!"_ said Djanni

They brought the caddies back and rescued another 40, 20 of them into the Transport 1.

_"There's blankets and some hot drink for you to heat yourselves in the rack at the left side. Please, take them and hand them out to everyone._ Il y a des couvertures et de la boisson chaude pour vous chauffer dans la grille sur le côté gauche. S'il vous plaît, prenez-les et distribuez-les à tout le monde. hnak albitaniaat wabaed almashrubat alssakhinat balnsbt lk litaskhin 'anfusakum fi alrafi ealaa aljanib al'aysur. yrja 'akhadhaha wataslimuha 'iilaa aljamie." said Jiminy, making his French and Arabic lessons pay their profits, and he looked everyone taking the blankets and the thermos with hot cocoa that were deployed before they got out.

_"Jiminy, ETA for tangos 30 seconds!"_ said Blue Fairy

_"Djanni, Kuntur, speed this up!"_ said Jiminy _"Cabby, take Kilimanjaro and Dumont and get out!"_

_"I'll gain some seconds, kid!"_ said Kilimanjaro.

An ex-villain, now a HWB cape as part of her parole, Josephine 'Josie' Nondaba was a weather controller: she could change the weather and use it to other things, like flying and shooting thunderbolts. She started to make the sea even more troubled just after Djanni left the last ones, sending some thunderbolts in the air nearby.

_"I can't do too much more!"_ said Kilimanjaro _"Hurry up!"_

_"Alright! Did it!"_ said Djanni

_"They are coming!"_ said Dumont, when they saw a RPG being shot. Sugarplum did a small swish with her fairy wand and put a magic shield in front of them where the RPG exploded.

_"Go, Jiminy, Cabby!"_ said Sugarplum. _"Kuntur, Djanni, Dumont, Kilimanjaro, let us make those tangos get away!"_ 

_"Right!_ Blue Fairy, _back to me! Provide me radar intel and provide me a traced route back ORSL 1! Need to focus on piloting!"_ said Jiminy, when he saw the small fairy-like quantum ghost "showing" herself "into" his eyes.

_"Aye, aye, captain!"_ said Blue Fairy, the line pointing general direction.

_"Djanni, Sugarplum, protect Transport 1! Kuntur, Kilimanjaro, on Transport 2!"_ said Dumont _"I'll give you cover!"_

_"Be ready to get out!"_ said Kilimanjaro _"I'll undo the weather control... Be ready!"_

Kilimanjaro did a move and Jiminy felt the storm intensifying.

_"Let's get out, Jiminy!"_ said Cabby, when they started to hear the bullets flying.

_"Hold yourselves!_ Tenez-vous! eaqad 'anfusakum!" said Jiminy, pulling the shaft lever for full power, after closing the door. He could hear the refugees somehow scared on the reaction. "Blue Fairy, _any chance you could do a radar like those on video-games into my line-of-sight?"_

_"Well, I can."_ said Blue Fairy _"But I fear you get too much information to focus, so you lose the focus on either piloting and  helping the others with your_ Bellax Analytica."

_"I had worst before... You don't know how much I felt at Nondaba village during an information oversurge that send my_ Bellax Analytica _amok. But less talk now!"_ said Jiminy

_"Okay, but if it goes overload, ask me to disengage ASAP!"_ said Blue Fairy, making a gesture and making the radar shows into his line-of-sight, on bottom-right of his visual field.

_"Everyone, they have big weapons, probably lots of RPGs!"_ said Jiminy _"Sugarplum and Kilimanjaro, use your powers to provide defense. Dumont, use the flares on_ Demoiselle _to meddle with the RPGs' electronics. Djanni and Kuntur, go for them. If needed, ram them!"_

_"Right, Jiminy!"_ said Sugarplum, and he saw her doing some magic on the helicopter back. He could see the RPGs launched exploding into the defense barriers lifted by Sugarplum and Kilimanjaro, or being take off course by Dumont's flares.

_"Jiminy... They're using torpedo boats!"_ said Djanni _"And there's at least six or seven tangos each boat. Looks like that also at least one breakthrough per boat."_

_"Alright!"_ said Jiminy _"Don't try to do the Super-Man by throwing the missiles back them, they activate on touch. Deal with as much of them you can, but safely! Cabby, full power forward!"_ said Jiminy, pulling the lever even more forward

_"Jiminy, slow down! You'll stress the turbine. There's a chance of a blast, and losing it or the shaft would result into a crash."_ said Cabby, and Jiminy brought back the lever to the safety power level.

_"Right!"_ Jiminy said, hitting the radio button in the control lever _"ORSL 1, we need reinforcements. Six torpedo boats, at least 50 tangos, estimated BT-ratio 1:5"_ BT-ratio, or _Breakthrough Ratio_, was the number of breakthrough per common tango.

_"Roger!"_ said Soldaire _"Squirrel Girl is taking my post. I'm getting there with Seven under Transport 3. Bring the tangos to the Inner Defense Line."_

The Inner Defense Line was the region from half an nautical mile radius from ORSL 1, and was accorded as a kind of _extra-national sovereign line_ for _Herós Sans Frontières_.

_"Everyone, we have to get into IDL. ETA 300 seconds from now!"_ said Jiminy.

_"We'll need to hold those tangos for_ FIVE freaking minutes?" said Sugarplum

_"And the weather is growing worse. Looks like they have their own weather manipulator. B-Class like me, or even A-Class."_ said Kilimanjaro.

_"On it, Kilimanjaro! Dumont, help Kilimanjaro! Djanni, Kuntur, go for the boats! Sugarplum, use your magic to destroy the boats' engines._ Blue Fairy, _get into the turret system!"_ said Jiminy

_"Jiminy, I'll go too far away from my computing capacity."_ said Blue Fairy _"If you want me on the turret, I'll need to take either the radar or the route tracer off."_

_"Take the tracer."_ said Jiminy _"And engage the system. Focus on disable their boats engines and to drop the fliers."_ 

_"Aye aye, sir."_ said Blue Fair, when Jiminy touched with his right hand a XLR connector for the copilot, "downloading" Blue Fairy. The turret engaged and started to shoot the boats.

_"Go on!"_ said Jiminy, when they saw the weather going cleaner.

The reason was just coming.

Seven was piloting Transport 3, a Mi-8 helicopter, and they could see Soldaire into his SolArmor, holding a kind of high-tech energy bazooka on his shoulder, locked to the Mi-8 by a magnetic air hook from SolArmor on a base reinforced by Dumont.

_"The cavalry is coming!"_ said Jiminy

_"Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful!"_ screamed Djanni in the comms.

_"Anyone need some help?"_ said Seven, nonchalantly on the Mi-8, and they could see also Blackstone, Chakra and Astra on it.

_"I'll reinforce your defenses now."_ said a suave voice into Jiminy's head, and he knew it was Chakra, the Tantric Merlin from Chicago Sentinels, that was maybe into the Mi-8, working via Astral Plane. 

_"Sugarplum, Kilimanjaro, help Djanni and Kuntur!"_ said Jiminy

_"Right!"_ said both of them

_"Astra, would you like to do the honors?"_ said Blackstone

_"Right!"_ she said, jumping from the helicopter and flying straight like a missile against one of the torpedo boat, that gone like a BOOOM! and exploded into smithereens.

_"Jiminy, Cabby, stick to the plan and go forward. Italian Sea Patrol was already alerted and they are a go for extra help."_ said Soldaire, taking his bazooka-like weapon and shooting a bolt of solid energy, that exploded another of the boats.

_"Right!"_ said Jiminy, while the others got and engaged into the combat. _"Full power on!"_

Jiminy pushed again the thrush for the turbo-shafts over operational power. Cabby understood.

_"How much we have until ORSL 1?"_ said Jiminy

_"ETA 90 seconds until IDL!"_ said Cabby

_"Right! Let us go!"_ 

The turbo-shafts screamed like Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Hades, but Jiminy took confidence on his _Bellax Analytica_ and push over.

_"The tangos are disengaging!"_ said Sugarplum _"One boat rescued some of then and departed!"_

_"Don't follow them!"_ said Soldaire _"It was enough. Let us get back ORSL 1."_

_"Jiminy, it's over. Disengage the full power!"_ said Cabby.

_"Right."_ said Jiminy, giving a _whew_ and pushing back the lever back to operation power. _"ORSL 1 in line of sight! We are at IDL."_

_"Alright."_ said Dumont

_"ORSL 1. Here are Transports 1 and 2. Some rescued refugees for processing with us."_ said Jiminy

_"Roger, Jiminy."_ said Squirrel Girl, via radio _"Welcome back."_

He engaged the autopilot and gave a weak smile and took a breath.

_"That was intense!"_ said Jiminy

_"In fact... Too much intense..."_ said Blue Fairy _"Why the_ Caliphate _was so eager to kill those refugees?"_

_"Beside the wrong idea of_ Jihad?" said Djanni _"They are murderers,_ murtadd _that thinks they are working for cleansing the world for the_ Mahdi. _They doesn't need a reason to kill: for them, they are_ Zindiq, _heretical to be killed."_

_"Well... We did our job right."_ said Cabby _"It's enough for me."_

_"For me too."_ said Jiminy, while they could see the two heliports: the one for Transport 1 and the other for the other helicopters. _"We're back home."_

## Chapter 4

> _"The ORSL project had lots of critics, and some of them sensible: to be fair, recommissioning oil rigs as a kind of island for refugees sounds like a good idea, but just_ SOUNDS LIKE. _In fact, wasn't the Vernes, people would be cramped as sardines into them: think that they were good for 2 or three hundred workers, and now needed to be recommissioned to receive, sometimes, 10 times this on civilians, beside all the crew, heroes, corps AND infrastructure. I don't believe this would be even possible pre-Event."_

> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

Joshua got out the meeting room he was using as class room: it was his last High School test, on Biology, and he also had another French and Arabic classes. He got to his room and got to the shower. 

_"How it was in the test?"_ said Eileen, getting back.

_"It was okay. Think I had graduated High School now."_ said Joshua, in shower _"But need to say, sometimes I feel I'm lacking something."_

_"In fact, you are. The experience on the college, dealing with classmates and so, bullies and friends, the good and bad."_ said Eileen _"You had the High School curriculum and the content, but, for good and ill, you hadn't the experience. But there's no way to see if this is good or not."_ said Eileen. _"But now, let us focus on what we have to do now. Are you going for triaging?"_

_"Yeah, just taking a shower before getting into costume."_ replied Joshua, while getting out the shower and drying himself. Then he put himself into a fresh costume and finished by putting his mask. 

The refugees were triaged into a special group of rooms that were built at the sea line level, that was grown into all directions to make it almost half mile sided. They had almost finished in the triaging and was sent via boats to Italy and then for other European countries. The last ones were People of Interest for _Herós Sans Frontières_ or other organizations, either by history and situation.

While Jiminy was getting down to the refugee center, Squirrel Girl came to him.

_"Jiminy, can I ask you a favor?"_ she said, wagging her squirrel tail back and forth with anticipation, like she was a little puppy.

_"How can I help you?"_ he asked, while he saw she had some of the refugees profiles with her.

_"We found this girl that looks like have some good intel about the_ Caliphate, _specially related with those people kidnapped from_ Roque Santeiro. _If so, any intel we can obtain can help. I think you understand this is a stain at_ Roque Santeiro _Diana wants to clean ASAP. "_ she says, passing Jiminy a folder with the girl's profile. _"We think that, either your powers, skills and even age can make her open herself to you."_

_"So, you want me to_ Pretty Please _her to provide us the intel?"_ asked Jiminy

_"Your discretion. I just don't want to break her up. She looks very panicked by all what happened with her. Looks like some of the refugees you rescued were_ Caliphate _runaways and defectors, which could explain the attack. So, we need to work them as much we can to milk all possible intel."_ said Squirrel Girl, while Jiminy took a look into the folder.

There was some information they already gathered: she was a Libyan refugee at _Roque Santeiro_ and her name was Wahiba Cissé. She was listed as one of the 50 girls kidnapped by the _Caliphate_ during the first attack against _Roque Santeiro_. She had given no more information about how she get away from the _Caliphate_ into that schooner: according the profile, looks like she had some kind of memory loss.

_"Alright. Think I can do this."_ said Jiminy.

_"Thanks. This will help us to talk and process the last refugees. I think there's more people coming, and we need to finish the ORSL deployment. ORSL 2 to 4 are already online, but 5 to 7 are still under recommission. Soldaire want us to help them."_ said Squirrel Girl _"Now, she's on Room 4."_ 

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy. 

Interview Room 4 is one of the 10 Interview Rooms where some POI under the refugees are sent to be interviewed more accurately by the capes or UNHCR personnel. Jiminy got into there and saw the girl: she was as young than himself and even more smaller, dressed into a kind of local vest and looked worried all around.

Jiminy read the profile and started to talk.

_"Ms. Cissé,"_ he said, talking in Arabic, as she's more comfortable on speaking it according the profile _"I'm Jiminy Cricket, from_ Herós Sans Frontières. _I think you know where and why you are here. And sorry if my Arabic is not good enough: if you want, I can ask for a translator if I'm not clear enough."_

_"No... Your Arabic is good for a non-Muslin."_ said Wahiba _"And I know where I am: I'm at ORSL 1, the first base in the newly created ORSL line. I'm being processed to be accepted as a refugee at Europe."_

_"Exact. Looks like you had been before at_ Roque Santeiro, _and was kidnapped by the_ Caliphate... _We need to know all we can on how you evicted yourself from them."_ said Jiminy

His _Bellax Analytica_ engaged just at this time, when he felt someone trying to get into his mind.

It was that girl!

_"Why are you doing this?"_ said Jiminy, trying to protect his mind from the sheer power of her, looking for her. She doesn't looks like the frighted fugitive she looked before: there was rage and fanaticism into her eyes.

"Murtadd, _this is our_ Jihad. _We are the new_ Seif-Al-Din, _risen by the Sword Verses_ Alsyf Alayat." she said, trying to use her mind prowess against Jiminy.

_"She's a Mentalist, at least B-Class!"_ thought Jiminy, hitting the button on his Jiminy Cricket-shaped crest to gave a red alert on his position

If she was an Atlas, Jiminy would be really at trouble. But as a Mentalist, her attacks were almost all based on trying to exert her will against others. And Jiminy had a great mind as a Mastermind.

_"No chance to_ Pretty Please! _her, at least by now!"_ he thought. He was feeling her getting into his mind. _"So, this is your game? Trying to get into my mind?"_ said Jiminy, a little worried. _"You want to undermine my will, by trying and find my fears?"_ 

_"You are as clever as said, Jiminy Cricket, but you have no chance against me."_ said the girl _"I'll bring you Allah's Justice that you avoided when you killed_ Alsyf Alayat"

_"He was meanie with me, with all of us from_ Roque Santeiro. _And he was killed by someone his side's action: that Suleiman guy invoked a demon, Valac, and he almost killed us all in the process."_

_"You're lying, as always_ Zindiq _like you do."_ said her, forcing even more her will against his. _"I feel your fear. I can smell your fear: you're as weak as a girl, a meek_ murtadd _girl."_

Jiminy snapped, when that girl pushed his memory back to the alley where he almost died.

_"You want to see my fears? Okay, but as someone said me, sometimes Allah (S.A.W) punishes us by granting us our wishes!"_ said Jiminy, doing quite the contrary he should do.

Normally on a mind attack you should fog and close your mind as much as you could. A common technique, teached to them by Chakra and Ozma, capes from _Chicago Sentinels_ that worked with mental powers, was mind chanting something to create "noise" so a mind attacker could not read or mess with his mind. In that moment, while the girl tried to attack Jiminy's mind, he was mind singing _Give a Little Whistle_ from Disney's _Pinocchio_ to protect himself from the invasion.

It was when Jiminy, feeling their mind connection, inverted the attack: he gave to her as much of his memories he could, at once.

He gave her at least 4 years of bullying and spanking. The memories with Derek Kwazani. The power overload at Nondaba Village. Fighting against a crazy Senesie under a psychotic breakthrough. The attacks from the now super-powered bullies, either Kyle and after that by Razorleaf, Ballistic and Presto.

And the earthquake, the aftermath of it, the _Humanity First_ attack, the house he lost, the process.

All the suffering he could remember, all his fears, all his pain, he pushed against her into only a mind blast, condensing all of it into a split second.

It was what he needed.

He felt her forced mind link being broken, as her mind was blasted by the memories he sent to her mind, and she screamed in pain, her hands into her head. Just at that time, Squirrel Girl and Djanni came into the room to both of them.

_"Djanni..."_ said Jiminy, still disoriented _"Hold her... Looks like she was a sleeper agent! Maybe a victim from the_ Sword Verses."

_"What?"_ said Djanni, holding the girl _"She was under an hypnotic suggestion from that_ murtadd?"

_"Sound like!"_ said Jiminy, panting _"Put her under a Sandman."_

Djanni putted a sandman bag over her head and closed it, inducing her into a sleep.

_"What happened, Jiminy?"_ said Squirrel Girl

_"I'll talk soon. Just give me an Aspirin and my cocoa thermos."_ he replied, while they give them what he asked, the Aspirin coming from a first-aid kid nearby.

He shoved the Aspirin down and gave a big gulp on the cocoa to put himself back on his feet.

_"And now..."_ said Squirrel Girl

_"Looks like she was targeting breakthroughs with any kind of mental power."_ said Jiminy _"I believe she suffered breakthrough under the_ Caliphate. _I saw some of their feelings when I inverted the attack: hate and fear. I feel that they made really really bad things with her, and she just didn't undergone a psychotic breakthrough by sheer luck."_ he said, taking another really big gulp on the thermos, almost emptying it. _"She was trying to put me back in the worst moments of my life, locking me into my mind... Maybe she would try something else after getting fully into my mind. But I gave her some of her medicine: I pushed all my worst memories to her on just a blink... It was too much for her."_

_"She looks really flinched."_ said Squirrel Girl _"Shouldn't you take lighter on her?"_

_"If I did, I would be killed or rendered under her control."_ said Jiminy _"I had to solve this fast and sound."_

_"Okay."_ said Squirrel Girl, looking through the Sandman bag _"Sounds like she's having a hell of a nightmare!"_

_"Looks like she's fighting something."_ said Djanni

_"Maybe she's trying to overcome the post-hypnotic suggestion. The pain she suffered by Jiminy attack loosed the_ Sword Verse's _ties."_ said Squirrel Girl _"Jiminy, can you help me? As soon Djanni removes the Sandman, use the best_ Pretty Please! _you can against her to make her calm down and goes sleepy, and to her hear only my voice. I'll try to remove the post-hypnotic suggestion. I want you and Djanni nearby all the time, right?"_

_"Right!"_ said Jiminy, Djanni nodding while slowly removing the Sandman.

Jiminy could see the suffering face of the girl but he could not go weak, as soon Djanni removed the Sandman.

"Pretty Please, _calm yourself down, Ms. Cissé. Rest yourself and trust us."_ said Jiminy, with the best studied _Pretty Please!_ he could, all the words and voice tone studied to do the effect.

They looked to her and she looked a little angry... But she felt herself drowsy.

_"Now, Ms. Cissé,_ Pretty Please _listen to my friend Dimantas here and only to her. Everything will end well. Rest and hear only her voice by now. Soon you pain will be over."_ said Jiminy

She looked even more calm and drowsy, when Ms. Dimantas, into a rare all human form, started to talk into a good, studied, tone _"You can only listen my voice now. You feel yourself bathed into a so good feeling. You feel yourself now so good, so calm, so comfy, so relaxed, that you'll get to sleep when I snap my fingers and you'll only hear my voice and only when speaking to you."_ she said, and then she snapped her fingers, which made Miss Cissé goes limp like a ragdoll, closed eyes, but into a kind of alert state that scared Jiminy.

_"Hypnosis doesn't work as people think, making people sleep, but by putting the person into a high alert mind-frame, one that normally he only listen the hypnotist, in fact, me. Weird thing: looks like she understand English enough. I didn't thought on this before: she should had some difficult on understanding the hypnotic triggers... But whatever. Normally I would work a little more before doing this, but there's no time for a full gig, so I'll need to somewhat MacGyver it. Think it will work, but I'm not 100% certain."_ said Lesley to Jiminy and Djanni, and then she looked back to the girl  _"Now, Ms. Cissé... I want you to talk with us on everything that happened since you were kidnapped at_ Roque Santeiro." she said, while taking a recorder from her utility belt pocket and hit the record button.

And she talked about how she was kidnapped, and put into a dark SUV, and how she and other girls were sent to a _Caliphate_ camp, where almost all of them were systematically raped by the _Caliphate_ men, one of them tried to rip her breasts out. It was when he menaced her and was raping her that she had her breakthrough, pushing all the pain she already had against him, rendering him almost crazy, and then she was brought to Alsyf Alayat, that used against her the _Sword Verses_, turning her into a sleeper agent to be sent by the Caliphate and to be used by the Caliphate men. She was trained as a suicide bomber but was not to be used as that, and her "mission" was to enter into Europe and work a cell with another Caliphate man in Italy, the same one that raped her into her Breakthrough. It was when she started to cry a lot. Djanni and Jiminy were very uneasy, but Squirrel Girl look to them.

_"It's alright... Now she almost had the post-hypnotic suggestion removed... She's crying now because she's scared, because she remembers somehow what she done under the_ Sword Verses." said Squirrel Girl

_"Never saw this before."_ said Jiminy, feeling queasy _"This made me feel bad for her."_

_"Don't."_ said Squirrel Girl _"She's relieving herself. I'll just finish to remove the suggestion and wake her up back on her own mind."_ 

She then looked to the girl and said.

_"Now, Ms. Cissé... I'll start to count from 10 to 1 and when I finish, you'll wake up, refreshed and freed from the post-hypnotic suggestion you were put under. No matter how and which triggered you, you will not be under it anymore, as you're freed from it, they don't influencing you no more. 10..."_ said Squirrel Girl, starting the countdown. When she came into 1, she snapped her fingers and Ms. Cissé woke up, astonished.

_"Alright, Ms. Cissé. We know what happened with you. Don't worry, you did no damage to us and you're safe here at ORSL 1."_ said Jiminy, on Arabic

_"What?! I... Attacked you?"_ she said, and started to cry _"Sorry... I didn't..."_

_"It's okay. You weren't on your mind when you did it."_ said Jiminy 

_"We need to talk dearly about all you could say for us about the_ Caliphate, _from where you were and about the other girls."_ said Djanni, into his perfect Arabic _"First, however, let us go pray for Allah the Most High and praise his forgiveness, now that you are free from their hands, and then we'll take a meal and talk, right?"_

She gave a meek smile, while Jiminy and Squirrel Girl took some carpets and putted it, pointed to Mecca, so Djanni and the Wahiba woman could pray.

After that, Wahiba talked all her history.

## Chapter 5

> _"The basic concept of a Breakthrough Camp is that you put people under death risk, but a controlled one. This sounds like a good idea: if you can control the circumstances, why not try to push people hard enough to trigger a breakthrough, but under a safe environment? This could provide Armies with the now so needed Atlases and Ajaxes and other breakthroughs for the modern battlefield. However, no matter what, this is a oxymoric concept: breakthroughs are a SURVIVAL triggered instinct and so there's no_ safe environments _for this. There's still no data backing this, as all the information about breakthrough camps are classified, but the theory is backed by some recent events: breakthrough camps are potential nightmares, and by pushing people hard like in the military conditioning and putting them under a so big mental stress, there's a incredible potential for psychotic breakthrough."_

> **Dr. Lesley Dimantas, _"On Artificially-triggered breakthroughs: Origin Chasing, Breakthrough Camps and their consequences"_, World Health Organization**

Two days passed after Wahiba event, and things were a little low in ORSL 1: as her situation had gone to worse after the attack against Jiminy, her refugee status was denied. However, as part of a super-powered organization, _Herós Sans Frontières_ adopter her as part of their roster, at least by now, by putting her as part of their sidekicking program, and that worked  as a way to provide her a Safe Haven as a refugee from the _Caliphate_. They found that Wahiba had already a good control on their mind powers: she just needed to master it and learn on how to use it under the law and the Rules of Engagement.

_"This is good **and** bad news."_ said Lesley, as the breakthrough specialist _"Good, because she had a good training in the time she was under the_ Sword Verse. _Bad, because this means that the Caliphate has some breakthrough camp, or at least some kind of training camp."_

_"Wahiba, what could you say us about this?"_ said Seiji, as always dressed on his best police uniform.

_"I don't remember too much: my memories on the time I was under the_ Sword Verse _are fuzzy and foggy."_ said Wahiba _"To be fair, I know how I can do somethings, but I can't remember were I learned them. For example, I can't remember how I learned a too good English."_

It was true: in two days, after the post-hypnotic trigger removals, Wahiba showed lots of knowledge beside her mind-powers as a B-Class Mentalist, like a very good English and Italian and how to use some pistols and do other personal defense techniques. 

_"Well... The good news on this all is that Wahiba is no more under the_ Sword Verse: _our experience at_ Roque Santeiro _says that, after the triggers are removed, the_ Sword Verse _victims had a fuzzy, foggy memory on the events in the time they were under it. This is coherent with hypnotic trance situations, and so it was not that weird."_ said Lesley.

_"And now, could I get back my family at_ Roque Santeiro?" asked Wahiba.

_"It's not that wise by now."_ said Seiji _"At least until we are 100% sure your powers are under control, we could not just allow you to go away and put people at risk. We'll just double check things and then, after you take your CAI certification and we know your powers are okay, you are totally free to get back_ Roque Santeiro _and to your family."_

_"And?..."_ was saying Wahiba

_"Your powers?"_ said Altayr _"They are yours, as Allah provided them to you by reasons only Him, as The One Who Knows All (S.A.W) knows. If you just choose to go and be a good woman on your community and never use again those powers, it'll totally up to you."_

_"Altayr is right, Wahiba."_ said Joshua _"Everyone can choose what to do with the powers received during the breakthrough, as long you don't do bad things against others. Each of us had critical situations under our breakthroughs and it's fair to choose what to do with the powers. I had almost been lynched to death by some bullies. After getting comatose for 6 months while recovering from the damages, just saving myself by using my_ Bellax Analytica _to find someone to bring me back my parents, I chose to put those powers under service for others as a way to thank God I was alive."_

_"He's right."_ said Lesley _"I remembered my breakthrough was just 3 or 4 years after The Event: I was in the field, working at time with Doctors Without Borders as a psychologist into a war-field at Tanzania, and there was a big animal stampede. I had slipped on my foot just in time to be stomped by some of the big beasts. It was when a hippo passed_ over _me, because_ I _was a meerkat at the time. I ran to the team and tried to say what happened: took me good two weeks until they understood I was now a Metamorph, and this only happened when I turned into a skunk, so stinking mad I was at time."_

_"So..."_ said Wahiba _"Everyone was at big risks?"_

_"Yeah."_ said Lesley. _"Breakthroughs are survival mechanisms every human being have, and that are triggered under stressful circumstances as a way to survive a dangerous circumstances. There's some very rare breakthroughs that achieve them naturally or under good, epiphaniac circumstances. Otherwise, the road to breakthrough is too much nearby the road to death."_

_"Understood."_ said Wahiba, when everyone heard a alarm all around.

_"All the capes for their positions. This is not a drill. Repeat: all capes for their positions. This is not a drill! This a Yellow Situation alert!"_ said the pre-recorded voice, into a monotone, synthetic, robotic voice.

_"Let's go!"_ said Lesley, while all of them start to run for their positions, and they saw Wahiba. _"It would be dangerous to left her behind, even with the post-hypnotic triggers lifted."_

_"She come with me..."_ said Joshua

_"Fat chance, short stuff."_ said Eileen _"We don't know how they could had influenced her, even she now being freed from the_ Sword Verse."

_"Another reason to be nearby some of us."_ said Richard _"If she still has any post-hypnotic suggestion on her, it would be better to be nearby, so we could contain her. And also, it would be harsh to put her on a cell just because. It would be that kind of_ Minority Report _pre-crime thing we should avoid. What you say, Jiminy?"_

Joshua looked for Wahiba and did a little concentration on his _Bellax Analytica_ and then he looked positively.

_"I think she's clean and clear to get with us."_ he said

_"Alright. She goes with you."_ said Eileen, being outvoted _"Let's go!"_

They split into three groups in a corridor. Jiminy and Wahiba got front into an elevator, while the others split themselves into two groups.

_"Dispatch, Jiminy here. I'm getting there. I'm with Wahiba Cissé, a civilian to be held safe, but civil. Copy?"_ said Jiminy via Earbug.

_"Copy. Jiminy, Soldaire here. I'm getting into with Team 2 on a heli. Get to Dispatch. Cabby and Cajun will be our pilots."_ said Soldaire

_"Copy. I'll be in a jiff there."_ he said, lowing his Cricket shaped mask, and Wahiba looked for him as _Jiminy Cricket_ for real for the first time.

They got into a small room, and two UN Berets gave them passage.

_"Wahiba, stay here."_ said Jiminy putting her into a chair while he got for the Dispatch chair and logged into the systems, opening window after window, three big screens with all the maskcams and tactical maps he needed to do his job as a Mastermind.

_"Dispatch, this is Transport 1 departing. Cabby piloting. Team is: Djanni, Kilimanjaro, Squirrel Girl, Panther, LionHeart."_ say Cabby

_"Dispatch, Transport 2 departing. Cajun on pilot. Team is: Soldaire, Sugarplum, Dumont, Kuntur, Hufflepuff."_ said Cajun

_"Transports 1 and 2, Dispatch here. Jiminy Cricket on it. Support is Blue Fairy. Deploying her for IDL system."_ said Jiminy, touching a spot to allow Blue Fairy to deploy herself into IDL defense batteries. _"Sounds like some tangos are getting nearby ORSL 1, and they are too much nearby IDL. No need for Havoc protocols by now, but be ready, as sounds like they want to bring the Foxtrot. Maskcam everyone, and non-lethal weapons until further notice."_

_"Roger..."_ all of them said, when Jiminy looked to the weather controls and the cams from the helis.

_"Everyone, be cautious! Sounds something is fishy on the weather."_ said Jiminy

_"Confirm here, Jiminy! A weird fog is getting nearby..."_ said Cabby

_"There's no fog! The weather system shows clean sky."_ said Jiminy, when they felt the first attacks

_"They are doing some mojo, I can feel it!"_ said Sugarplum _"Illusory Magic! They have some supernatural breakthrough, and he's powerful, at least on this mojo. Need to find him!"_

_"Working on it! Djanni, Kuntur, drop Hufflepuff and LionHeart on some of those boats. Dumont, on Soldaire. The others, rock and roll on them."_ said Jiminy, passing intel to them.

It was when he looked and Wahiba was silently into a kind of mediation.

_"Wahiba..."_ said Jiminy, when he heard her voice into his mind.

_"I think I can find him via Astral field. Let me try it."_ said Wahiba's voice.

_"Alright, I'll try to get time for you. Blue Fairy, what can you do to gain time for Wahiba and the others?"_ said Jiminy

_"Not too much: the IDL is for self-defense, not long-range attack... I think I can try to give some called shots, but nothing bigger than this."_ said Blue Fairy, without showing herself, as she was "deployed". She started to attack with the weapons in the system.

_"Okay. Do the best you can."_ said Jiminy _"Everyone, give Wahiba time to work to find this supernatural guy..."_

_"I found him: he's in a big boat a little after the first line."_ said Wahiba's voice.

_"Found it! Get back, they can have someone with your type of power there."_ said Jiminy, looking into a tactical map and clicking some point and hitting some keys into your keyboard. _"Tagged the tango on the map, put the intel on your maskcams as a pointer. Kuntur, Squirrel Girl and Djanni, go for it. Kilimanjaro and Sugarplum, support them. Dummont and Panther, help the others to break the tangos line! Bring them the Foxtrot!"_

_"Roger!"_ said everyone, getting into the action

_"The guy is protected by some breakthroughs."_ said Wahiba, still into her Astral form _"None of them supernatural, thankfully. Sounds he's B-Class: he can create that illusion, but needs to stay concentrated to hold it. The other guys sounds like Ajaxes and at least one Verne, with a weird bow."_

_"Okie-Dokie!"_ said Djanni, flying to the guy. _"Kilimanjaro, Sugarplum, send some gust of wind against those guys!"_

_"Roger!"_ said both, using their powers to make wind to hit the Illusory guy protectors. Kuntur, Djanni and Squirrel Girl got on it. 

_"Have a funny and effective idea!"_ said Djanni _"Kuntur and me will fight the rest of the rabble. Squirrel Girl, he'll be all yours!"_

_"What should I do?"_ said her, with a bird-like voice tone as she was now an albatross.

_"Do your worst, you're the Metamorph here. If it was me, I would get near enough and turn into a really small critter and run all around his shirt to break his concentration and then I would use my powers to give him a lesson he would never forget."_ said Djanni, giggling. Jiminy gave also some kid giggle on his point before got back serious.

_"Alright, sounds a fun idea. Just give me time."_ said Squirrel Girl, while Djanni and Kuntur removed the guy guards. _"Let's go!"_

She turned herself into a white mouse, getting into the guys shirt. _"alkhuruj manya, 'ant alfiran laenat!"_ they could hear him screaming, trying to remove Squirrel Girl, that run around him, breaking his concentration and making the illusory fog fade away like a dream.

_"Now, everyone! Bring them the Foxtrot! Squirrel Girl, knock this guy out! Djanni, Kuntur, acquire him!"_ said Jiminy

_"Roger!"_ said both, while Squirrel Girl got out the man's clothes.

_"Yuck!"_ said her, back to her human form, only using his preferred weapon, a skunk's tail, turning to him _"He stinks so much I don't think my aroma will make him get even worse."_ she said, and then she sprayed the guy straight in the face. She took her tail, gave a whiff and said _"No... I think this will do. Although I don't get queasy on my own stink."_

While the guy was puffing, trying to breath fresh air without the cloud of skunk stink, Djanni gave a dash and blasted against the guy, taking him out of it and giving a punch on his stomach. From the utility belt everyone used, he took a pair of the special Blacklocks for supernatural users made on Fake Orichalcum _"Alright, target acquired!"_ he said, taking him to the helicopter. 

_"Look like he was the boss. The other are retreating. Dispatch?"_ said Soldaire, after shooting a guy unconscious.

_"Don't pursue. Acquire the tangos left behind and bring them to processing at ORSL 1."_ said Jiminy _"I'll write the After-Action Report after having some talk with them. I want everyone with me."_

_"Can I get into this?"_ said Wahiba

_"No... You're not..."_ said Jiminy

_"I know that I'm not officially part of your team..."_ she said timidly _"But maybe I can help somehow."_

_"Soldaire..."_ said Jiminy, while everyone was back into the helis

_"I think we can use some of the knowledge on the Caliphate Wahiba have. Until we clear her, however, she'll only get there with someone else."_ said Soldaire

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy, while waiting for the guy coming back

## Chapter 6


> "People criticize _Herós Sans Frontières_ for accepting into their rosters some of the _undesirable_ breakthroughs in the world. In my team itself, we had LionHeart, Panther and Kilimanjaro, all of them convicted under parole, in LionHeart's case a life sentence. Ad we have Djanni, a refugee kid. And me, a kid that should be at Whitlow or Hillwood or other super-kids school... And there's lots of similar cases on HSF rosters. But, in fact, we can't spare any hero. For our work, any hand we can put on it is an extra hand to help it. Obviously, all of them is double-checked and so, and HSF faces the responsibility associated on having so uncommon heroes on their rosters. But, as by our motto, _Super-help for super-needs_ also applies there: many of them just wanted a better way to use their powers, and HSF provides them"

> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

_"So, let us made this straight: you knew were Wahiba was and used her as a bait."_ said Soldaire for the man in front of him.

_"You'll never..."_ said him when Jiminy didn't waited

"Pretty Please! _I know you want to kill yourself and us if possible. Don't! We are not your enemies! You'll be treated well and everything provided to you while detained here will be_ halal. _But we need you to help us: those girls could, and probably are, in the same position than Wahiba was, being raped and raped."_ said Jiminy

_"They are our wives._ If you experience rebellion from the women, you shall first talk to them, then deserting them in bed, then you may beat them." said the guy

_"This is_ haram!" screamed Wahiba _"You know it: you are distorting The Prophet's words (S.A.W.). As always, you're abusing on Verse 34, Sura 4. But in truth I say, Sura 3, Verse 195, that Allah the Merciful states:_ 'I never fail to reward any worker among you for any work you do, be you male or female, you are equal to one another...' _Rape is never about sex or law, it's about power. They disgraced me! And used me."_

_"So..."_ said Jiminy, while Djanni consolated Wahiba on her sadness _"You know about it, right?"_

The man gasped: in his gloating, he didn't noticed he fell under Jiminy's _Pretty Please!_ "Sihr!", he screamed. Jiminy knew what this means: _"Sorcery"_

_"No... Breakthrough."_ said Jiminy, calmly 

_"Enough."_ said LionHeart, snapping his fingers _"I don't have too much patience for wannabe villains that f%$k it up with women lives. I killed myself at least a dozen of those wannabes. One more into the account would not be that bad."_

_"No way,_ murtadd. _Allah is merciful..."_ he saw, when LionHeart just punched the table, blasting it into smithereens.

_"Allah can be merciful with good-for-nothing guys like you, but I'm not."_ shouted LionHeart _"If you don't start to spill it out, I'll f#$king smash your head to a pulp,_ capiche?"

_"Menaces will not take us forward_, murtadd." said the guy

_"Not if I put some bacon on your food or even some drops of bacon fat on your water!"_ said LionHeart, which made everyone there gasping, Djanni looking very badly for LionHeart.

As part of the cooking team for ORSL 1, LionHeart was the one responsible for making the food for the team. And he knew enough about Islam to know that they would never eat anything that even came in contact with pork and so. The fear of conpurscate his soul by eating _haram_ food would be enough to press him.

Jiminy gasped: it was harsh, but his _Bellax Analytica_ was showing him that it could be effective.

"Pretty Please! _sir. We are trying to be civil with you, but we need to you to show some civility also and give us something to compensate. You were acquired. If you be civil and pass us the information we need about the_ Caliphate _training camp, I'll ensure you'll be treated well on all your needs."_ said Jiminy

_"How you know about..."_ said the guy

_"... the camp? Wahiba was too much well trained for whatever mission she would had in Europe."_ said Soldaire, into his SolArmor, but without the helmet: this way, he could exert some of the benefits on it with an indefinite time. _"So, it's just a matter-of-fact to know she had on a kind of training camp. And also, we know that, after Wahiba had undergone breakthrough and the post-hypnotic suggestion by_ Alsyf Alayat, _she was there, to be trained on self-defense, weapon shooting, and all she needed to build a terrorist cell at Italy, maybe resulting into a suicide attack."_

_"So..."_ said Hufflepuff _"Are you ready to talk? Or you'll risk to cross my friend_ Corazón de Leon'_s wrath? Believe me, you'll not want to bet you own soul to damnation just to see how far he could go._ Violadores _are one of the few things that made him go mad enough to try to violate his own parole."_

The guy crossed eyes with LionHeart, and the steel and fire of the wrath in LionHeart's eyes was like almost burning him.

_"Alright!"_ said the guy, looking away from LionHeart, and Jiminy saw that the _bad cop/good cop_ thing had worked, with a little _Pretty Please!_ help _"But I want all my food_ halal, _and not served by this crazy guy."_

_"No problem:"_ said Djanni _"I'll double check everything. I'm studying to be a_ mullah, _and I'm already an_ Imam _here. So, I'll make sure all your food will be_ halal."

_"So... Let us get business, now that you are okay with all this."_ said Soldaire _"First of all, about the people the_ Caliphate _abducted from_ Roque Santeiro _last year: where they are?"_

_"Many were brought to justice: many of them were killed, brought to justice under Allah. Only the kids and women were spared: we need_ Mujaheddin _for the_ Jihad. _But all the men were killed."_

_"So, you know that you are under capital punishment by international law by multiple manslaughter and genocide."_ said Soldaire _"But we are the ones to judge you: if you will get this, it will by the International Criminal Court that will decide. Let us stay on the topic: and the women and girl? And the camp?"_

_"They are at Sudan, nearby the desert, in Darfur..."_ said the man

_"Alright... Darfur... Always a powder barrel, even pre-Event, but seems legit: with all the mess on the_ Caliphate War _and_ Eretz Israel, _they had come below the radar."_ said Soldaire _"Now, I want you to say everything you know about the place: troops, numbers, main guys, all the things. Everything you can remember. And I'll remember you this is being recorded and will be used by ICC as part of your prosecution. If you are collaborative enough, you can take some benefits, or at least avoid a capital punishment."_ said Soldaire.

And the guy started to spill the beans, while Jiminy, Djanni, Wahiba and LionHeart got out the room.

_"You should not took that harsh with him, LionHeart."_ retorted Djanni _"Menace kill him, not to put him under_ haram! _We were lucky he reconsidered, but those_ murtadd _could try something really nasty after being confronted to be under_ haram, _even unintentionally!"_

_"I was being business: I don't have patience with women-abusive guys. In my Bronx Shoulder's time, I had really killed some guys that tried to abuse woman, you can check this on my profile. My mother was abused by my so-called_ stepfather, _the guy that 'cared' for her while my father was dying on a heart stroke and he thought on me as a sissy because I loved my mom... It was until he tried to kill her, I'm already a breakthrough, and I hit him hard enough to no more get nearby my family."_ said LionHeart _"And all the times I was a bouncer in nightclubs, I always protected those who are being abused, either women or LGBT people. It was just into one of those that I was captured."_ said LionHeart, talking his story.

_"I was in my work as bouncer at a club, and a guy was trying to rape a woman. I thought_ 'Easy, just a good-for-nothing punk that is high on meth and wants to have some so called fun and is a big of piece of shit to get laid with a woman as people should'. _But the problem is that this guy was a rise star as a super-villain in one of the local gangs, a B-Class Atlas with also some Laser Projection powers. I had hit him hard from the start, and even thought I killed him, but the guy just gave a maniacal smile and came to fight me, crazy for a_ tag _against the famous Bronx Shoulder... Our fight called the action from the local Super-Police, and the rest is history. What I can say is that I avoided the escalation as much as I could, but that guy deserved to be killed. I had the satisfaction to just see his empty eyes when I snapped his neck like a twig, and then I offered my wrist so the police could put the Blacklocks."_ he said, and Jiminy noted on how much old LionHeart's face had gone, how tired he looked, and how scary he could be.

_"Sorry kids... I didn't wanted to show you this side of me."_ said LionHeart

_"It's okay."_ said Jiminy

_"Yeah!"_ said Djanni _"And, if he was so extreme under the Shar'ia, he should know that, if you killed him, you would be fair."_

_"But this is not how we should do things. We comply with international law, not Shar'ia or Leviticus law."_ says Squirrel Girl _"I understand your rage, LionHeart, but next time please contain yourself."_ 

_"I'll try."_ said LionHeart, meekly.

_"And about this guy, what we have?"_ said Jiminy, trying to exchange topics.

_"He's a B-Class Illusionist: a Merlin with some discreet powers."_ said Squirrel Girl _"Now, he's Afeef Nagi, 32, and if his history is okay, he was part of old Lebanon Army during the_ Caliphate War _and was nearby Tel-Aviv enough to feel the power of the atomic bomb. I think this triggered him the breakthrough, so he could survive the nuclear dust by pushing it aside. He and his family was expelled from Lebanon as part of_ Eretz Israel _and he swore vengeance against them because of this: his parents died in the diaspora while he got to Karthoum and some of the his comrades at the Lebanon Army came into contact with what would became the_ Undying Caliphate. _He was in the action against_ Roque Santeiro, _and he send the women and kids to a camp somewhere in Darfur. We can't take any action, however, until we confirm the intel."_ said Squirrel Girl when they saw the anxious faces of them.

_"And maybe we'll not do it."_ said Soldaire, while some of the MaxBerets took the man to send him to a cell _"We have a mission on ORSL that is more important than revenge or so. We'll do our job and send the intel for the big kahunas on LDS and UN, and they choose what to do."_

_"I would want to join this."_ said Wahiba

_"You're not a military cape and not a CAI-trained one."_ said Soldaire _"If you want to help you and your people, I can say we can take your talents as Mentalist here in ORSL: extra communication and intel possibilities are never enough. This is what I can do by know for you."_ 

_"I want it: I don't want others suffering as I had."_ said Wahiba

_"For me it's okay: I'm just waiting the red paper to be solved to put you as sidekick on our team. But we need a capename for you..."_

_"Marjanah!"_ said Wahiba _"She was a Slave for Ali Baba, and saved him from the Forty Thieves in the story in the 1001 Nights. I thought on Scheherazade, but is so obvious. And Ali Baba recognized her loyalty and his son fell in love by her and married her in the end."_

_"Alright..._ Marjanah. _I'll send everything for HSF ASAP. I just need the papers that UN are readying for you as a Stateless, so we can put you under our responsibility and perhaps try the refugee status for you at Switzerland, HSF HQ. Are we okay?"_

_"Yes!"_ said Wahiba, or better, _Marjanah_, happily.

_"Sorry about all this, kids."_ said LionHeart, meekly _"I lost myself."_

_"No problem, Ric."_ said Jiminy _"We know this... But maybe you need to clean his mouth with soap."_

_"Yeah... And Djanni... Sorry about..."_

_"No problem... As Jiminy said, we know you lost your mind."_ said Djanni which made LionHeart give a small meek smile.

## Chapter 7

> _"If you think a CAI team life is like what is shown on_ The Sentinels, _I'm sorry to be the one to break your illusions. We fight villains, sure, but this is exception, not rule. There's few really powerful villains I had fight, like Derek Kwazani and Alsyf Alayat. The biggest problems we deal with normally are things like natural disaster or humanitarian catastrophe. And the red paper: sometimes I wanted to have more super-villains and less bureaucracy to deal with."_

> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

_"Thank you to coming with me, Joshua."_ said Richard, on the plane, with a special tracking device in his ankle, two guys behind then with some special Vernetech laser weapons.

_"It's okay: Soldaire was called to have a talk with the_ Warriors _and_ Protectors _in Japan about HSF, and if more muscles got out ORSL 1 it would be a problem. And for me it's okay to get with you to your parole officer."_

Richard McInroy, capename _LionHeart_, formerly known as _The Bronx Shoulder_, was a special case in many levels: as convicted by manslaughter, he was under a life sentence, but he was given a parole and put under _Herós Sans Frontières_. He had a Vernetech tracking device implanted under his neck to be used if he tried to run away. But he never showed any will to run away, even when he should: he was the only one that didn't directly worked into the black-op to extract him from _Alsyf Alayat_'s grasp and so he also didn't fight Valac, the Goetia demon invoked by a deceased Merlin from the _Caliphate_, because he didn't wanted to break his parole.

LionHeart normally talked with his parole officer via video-conference monthly, but he was obliged by the parole terms to at least once yearly to get a in-real-life encounter with him. Joshua then was asked to be the one the go with him to New York for it: even being underage, as a CAI-Certificated breakthrough, he had legal power to escort a "criminal under parole" to his parole officer under the terms of LionHeart's parole. It would be easy: just leave him at a previously accorded police district where he would encounter the guy and then take him back some hours after.

_"And about that Presto kid?"_ said Richard, while they where adjusting their belts for the landing. _"I heard he was calling for sidekicking at HSF."_

Carlyle Galatas, capename _Presto_, was one part of the bullies who made Joshua undergoes breakthrough. However, he was under it because of peer pressure: he worked against the leader of the ones who attacked Jiminy after his talk at Newark, Razorleaf (real name: Jonathan Leaf). Because of this, he was put under a parole that allowed him to get back Whitlow and then finish his schooling. He then got under Hillwood, but he wanted to go for sidekicking at _Herós Sans Frontières_.

_"Look that the big guys liked the idea of putting people under a parole into HSF. Looks like they approved Presto as sidekick for our team: ORSL is a very important project, and we need all capes we could put into it. I'll escort him back ORSL 1 with us."_ said Jiminy, while they saw JFK airport growing and felt the wheels touching the track. Then, they got ready to get on.

---

Joshua had lots to do while waiting LionHeart does his talk with his parole officer: he got back to HSF NY HQ to give some papers and disks for archiving and to talk about Presto. He was received by the local clerk, a woman called Cynthia Williams:

_"Hey, Jiminy, long time no see!"_ she said

_"It was really a time. We were really occupied with ORSL 1: I had no time to get to Eurodisney and so. Think last time I had on any Disney Park was just after the process."_ said Joshua

Joshua was put under court, accused of attempted manslaughter, because an attack some _Humanity First_ers did against his former home at Newark. During it, he shot a guy with the laser part of his _Jiminy Cane_, in his hand and leg. The process was somewhat easy to be won, as he did everything fair and square, and his After-Action Report was put under the scrutiny of many people, including Chicago Sentinels' Blackstone. But it was a time that Joshua would like to forget: without his house, his tree-house _sanctum_ and with all pressure on him and his parents, he was just a pinch to freak out.

_"So, Seiji sent you to send us the archive data, including the last After Action Reports."_ she said

_"Yup."_ he said, taking from his side a _Pinocchio_-themed mailbag, and from it taking a set of Digital Tapes. _"All of our last 6 months at_ Roque Santeiro, _including_ Alsyf Alayat _actions, and all the missions under ORSL 1, even the resupplying ones. Everything fair and square."_

_"Wow, such a nice boy we have here."_ said Cynthia, making him blush: she knows he was the unofficial clerk, and he double-checked all the After-Action Reports for his team. _"Alright: I'll ask the guys to load the data on our systems and then give you the tapes back. It will take a time, so do you want to have some lunch?"_ 

_"I'll go soon: I just came to see Presto. Think he is now officially under HSF, as part of his parole on the Newark High School. I'll take him and them we'll get and take LionHeart from his parole meeting and then, back to ORSL 1."_

_"Yeah, I know: but Presto is still in some red paper, and the tapes will take some time to be processed and loaded at our systems. I think you should at least eat something."_ said Cynthia.

_"Okay."_ he said

While a guy, who looked like a common clerk, took the Tapes and gone with them to a room, Cynthia ushered Joshua to the internal restaurant: HSF had a internal restaurant because all the superbads that wanted to tag the HSF heroes. He saw lots of the capes that used NY HQ as headquarters for their operations for HSF.

_"Callisto!"_ said Jiminy, looking for a woman into a psychedelic painted costume, like a tie-dyed leotard, a purple domino mask over her face and a kind of electric rainbow painted hair, that Jiminy still doubt it was a wig or her hair.

_"Heiya, Jiminy!"_ said Callisto, an A-Class photo-kinetic.

_"Hey, Marie!"_ said Joshua, while taking a tray and putting on it a plate, a fork and a knife _"How it was things on Honduras?"_

_"Same, same... Being so near that Narcos nuts from Mexico is a bore. And now there's the ultra-right guys that are forming militias, some of them origin chasing. Lesley don't hear us, but if those nuts just killed themselves on origin chasing I would be glad, but some of those morons are really undergone breakthrough. Last one was the common Ajax, but the ones that doesn't deserved the name: strong as the original, but smart... quite the contrary. C-Class, but enough to being inconvenient and try to pull us out... But not enough to do the thing."_ she said, while they were going to the cater _"Heard you had took some_ Caliphate _dumb-os some days before."_

_"Yeah."_ said Jiminy _"They tried to 'tag' us at ORSL 1, but we had an extra help: one of the girls that they abducted from_ Roque Santeiro. _She's now a sidekick for us: A-Class Mentalist, and very smart, she had undergone breakthrough on her time with the_ Caliphate _, and then she put under a suggestion by that Alsyf Alayat guy and trained by them to do some terrorist job at Europe, but got into us before. Now she's clear, and she chose the capename_ Marjanah. _She's a good girl."_

_"Heard of. Those_ Caliphate _bastards are the worst: I hate them as much as the Narcos or the Militias.  Need to say: if we were like those pre-Event comics, with super-villains that only had some henchmen to deal with, I would love. Those morons uses people as meat-shield. They are even worse because they though on themselves as the new Castro or Stalin or whatever, but they are just a bunch of good-for-nothing guys."_ said Callisto _"I can respect a_ real real _Cause Villain like_ Seif-al-Din _or_ Alsyf Alayat, _because I can understand, even not agreeing with them: they have motives, many of them somewhat sensible. Those Narco morons are just bullies."_

_"Agreed."_ said Jiminy, when Cynthia looked to him and says:

_"Take some veggies, Joshua!"_ which made everybody laughs, and Joshua blushes.

_"Okay..."_ he said, taking some veggies.

Some after he sat and started to eat, he saw Carlyle getting into the restaurant: he was dressed into a brand-new costume, like  Presto from the old _Dungeons & Dragons_ cartoon, his belt changed by the default utility belt for CAI-certified capes. He wasn't using mask: as part of his parole, his _Presto_ identity was just a _Private_ one, the only protection being a wig changing his hair from his normal black to auburn.

_"Hey, Jiminy!"_ said Presto, looking for him 

_"Presto!"_ said Joshua, when he came with food tray 

_"It was nice_ Herós Sans Frontières _accepted me at their sidekicking program: things were starting to grew nasty at Hillwood."_ he said while sitting in another chair.

_"How?"_ said Joshua.

_"You see: I was convicted by attempted manslaughter. So, the other capes-in-training looked to me as just a little better than a_ real _super-villain. But I realized how much on me was just a poise. I tried to look cool, to be with the so-called cool kids. Never thought before on all this, even after we did what we did with you. It was in front of that situation at school that I thought really on what I was doing: was I really ready to flush my life at sewer?"_ he said _"And I though that I would not do this. I had to accept myself. As I said, things were not easy at Hillwood: people started to bully me, even the nerds being reticent to accept me, even me being a D&D Dungeon Master, what I used as a way to have some social contact. I held myself, and it was when Grendel came and talked with us: him and Ozma are the most known alumni from Hillwood, as they are now at Chicago Sentinels."_

Joshua agreed: he knew from some time before Grendel, part of the _Young Sentinels_, the young super-team supported by the _Chicago Sentinels_. He was one of the heroes that somewhat rescued him when his old-time main bully, Kyle Montague, tried to attack him at Metrocon.

_"He said that we always pay the price for our choices, but we should pay the price and only it, and people should not make other's burdens even heavier, because they can be already heavy enough..."_ he said, eating a little, _"and we should just be judged by what we did now, not by our past. I chose then to ask for sidekicking training at_ Herós Sans Frontières, _and they approved it. Just finished to register my definitive capename and my crest."_ he said, proudly, showing the badge with a green magician hat on it, like the one he was using over his head. _"And when we'll go?"_

_"Just let us finish the meal and take LionHeart back..."_ said Joshua, when his cellphone called. He looked worried, as it was his "hero line", the number used when he wasn't on Earbug like now. _"Jiminy Cricket..."_

_"Jiminy, it's me, LionHeart..."_ LionHeart said, with a tired and worried voice _"We need your help ASAP!"_

_"What happened?"_ he said

_"We were attacked: some punks with very powerful weapons. My parole officer was kidnapped!"_ 

_"What?! Just a minute!"_ said Joshua, looking for Cynthia _"I need to put my costume: LionHeart's in trouble. Presto, I want you to come with me. Callisto, if you can help..."_

_"Sure!"_ said Callisto, while everyone was leaving their half-eaten meal behind. Not a uncommon vision at HSF: they always were _Super-Help for Super-needs_, and almost all HSF permanent heroes lived under that effigy.

_"You can use the dressing room just beside the restaurant entrance."_ said Cynthia

_"And I need to borrow a_ Ecureuil _heli."_ he said while getting to the dressing room, taking his bag with his spare costume. _"I'll take Presto and Callisto and deploy them as near LionHeart we can."_ 

_"Are you sure?"_ said Cynthia

_"I have a helicopter brief that allows me to pilot a Squirrel."_ said Joshua, while getting into and dressing hastily. As he did this so much in his life after breakthrough, it was almost like Superman: in just 5 minutes he was ready.

_"Alright! Let me just double-check things."_ said Cynthia for Jiminy, as soon he put the Earbug _"Okay, sounds everything okay. Granted you authorization: take the NYH 02 at the garage. The boys there will be waiting you to show you it. Dispatch will update you with any intel needed."_

_"Right..."_ said Jiminy, getting out, and looking for Callisto and Presto. _"Presto, if you wanted to know what is a cape life, it's showtime."_

_"Roger..."_ said Presto, going with them.

## Chapter 8

> _"I had lots of enemies, but none of them was like my worst enemy at all_, Alsyf Alayat. _Even after his defeat, his powerful_ Sword Verses, _the post-hypnotic trance he laced on people, had worked his way in more than an action. I don't know how much sleeper agents he made and how many is everywhere... But sometimes I still have nightmares with him. About other villains, normally I could deal with them. But always there's one or two that surprised us on his fierceness or recklessness."_
>
> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

_"Nevada-Yankee-Hotel 02 for Air Force. Jiminy Cricket on the lever. I'm getting nearby the lockdown airspace. Asking for access granting. Copy?"_ said Jiminy. He was with Presto at his side and Callisto on the back, near the door, ready to jump. Her photo-kinetic power allowed her to fly as long there was light: she used photon winds as propulsion, and also made a kind of board where she surfed the light, so flying in the sky. But sometimes she preferred to stay in the ground or in vehicles, as when she was flying she was vulnerable because some limitations on how much light she could bend to do her mojo.

_"Copy. Colonel Masters here. I don't know what the f$%k they wanted with this friend of you, but he messed with the wrong people. NYC airspace is at a total lockdown, even the capes needing to be authorized to flight. You are okay. But need to say that's weird to see a 13 year old kid like you piloting a helicopter."_ said the man by the radio

_"Occupational Hazard."_ said Jiminy, and this made the man at the other side laugh _"How is LionHeart?"_

_"Not good: those guys knew what they wanted to do and what they would need to deal with. He is alive and in a whole piece, but he's still flinched. Are you taking him?"_ said Colonel.

_"Can you open a space in some junction I can touch down the heli? The streets per se has not too much space and there's no clear heliports nearby."_

_"I think that I have a space: take the next junction and go there. My boys are cleaning the space for you."_

_"I promise it will be super-fast."_ said Jiminy, going there.

He never did a touchdown on a so cramped space, beside at simulator, but he had a good help, albeit a little pesky.

_"Right... Right... Come on... Now just get down..."_ said Blue Fairy, dressed into a airport marshaller uniform, pointing some sticks.

_"Alright... I can do this!"_ said Jiminy, trying to not yell with her. 

_"Sorry... I..."_ said Blue Fairy, when Joshua said meekly

_"I'm to be sorry... I don't like when things goes this overboard."_ said Jiminy, when the helicopter touched the ground and he shut it down.

_"We'll just stay as much as needed, right? We need to free traffic ASAP."_ said Jiminy for Presto and Callisto

_"Right."_ he said, going for the building where LionHeart and the parole officer.

Or better, on what remained on it.

There was a big hole in the wall, debris all around. LionHeart was into a stretcher, with a no-friends face.

_"Are you okay? What happened?"_ said Jiminy, really worried, when looking on all the stretches and spots over LionHeart body. He was on civil, as by the parole terms.

_"I still want to know."_ said LionHeart _"Looks like those guys were against Darius, my parole officer. I just noticed a weird flash in the streets by the window, and looked: it was a guy on those ninja costumes, holding an RPG, just beside a black van. I just had time to take him from the way and receive the worst on the hit. I just blacked out a little after the guys coming into the room."_

_"Breakthrough?"_ said Jiminy

_"Can't say, didn't saw..."_ said LionHeart, when some officers came.

_"I think you're Jiminy Cricket. Officers Jefferson Papalliounous and Suzan McDaggert. Call me Jeff and her Suzan."_ said the officer, with a beak nose followed by the woman, that looked strong and very beautiful on green eyes and a flame red hair. _"She's my partner, and she's a B-Class Ajax. She is one of the officers that follows LionHeart's parole."_

_"Thanks. Those with me are Callisto, a HSF cape that came on help for us, and Presto, our new sidekick."_ presenting the officers to the other capes. Joshua was trying to not thinking on assuming front-line command of a team, even a improvised one. _"Do you job now, freak later."_ he thought _"What you have? Any cameras?"_

_"Some local security cameras got some images."_ said Suzan, pushing a small device, while LionHeart sat in the stretcher. It was a small video player, with a flash-drive on it.

_"Blue Fairy, be ready to try and see all you can and use any information source you can provide us."_ he thought

_"Roger!"_ she said, after changing instantly to a police officer costume.

They started to saw and there was the van, and some guys getting down from it, going to the café next, taking some Starbucks lattes. Some minutes after, one of them, on a ninja costume, got down and pushed fast the RPG launcher. The warhear was already armed and he should be really strong: just needed to catch it and put it over his shoulder like it was a towel and pressed the button for the shoot. It didn't took more than half a minute. He dropped the launcher and got at the van, while two guys, using some ornithopters got and took a man in the room, leaving LionHeart behind.

_"I think I have some clues, Jiminy!"_ said Blue Fairy _"Ourobouros Files register this event as part of a plot to try outlaw capes once and for all, even in police forces."_

_"Alright, and..."_ thought Jiminy

_"Darius Menard is a first-time cape supporter: in fact, he was one of the passengers in the plane Atlas saved first time at all during The Event. He turned into a police officer and was into Bronx Shoulder acquiring operation. When he saw that Ric tried to avoid casualties, he put into his report this, and this was a crucial proof to allow Ric to be under a parole, not at a SuperMax. He was a first-time breakthrough supporter, and is a specialist on breakthrough laws."_

_"Anything about the tangos?"_ thought Jiminy, when the officers looked to him

_"Kid, anything..."_ they started to say, when Jiminy shooed them and said 

_"Please, I'm trying to think and see if I can have anything."_ said Jiminy _"Have something about the tangos?"_ he asked for the guys, while thinking _"Blue Fairy, just a minute."_

_"The van was stolen, and looks like the guys are smart enough to not show their faces. But what we know is that they gone East Side."_ said Jeff _"And what you can say?"_ 

_"Nothing too much... But they had internal knowledge."_ said Jiminy _"They came prepared to deal with an Ajax. A HEAT RPG warhead is not like buy a Nintendo. One of those is really big investment. What you can say about this Darius guy?"_

_"Breakthrough supporter."_ said Suzan _"He was one of those that were pro-Mask. He even gone to a law course on all this, saying how in his vision, the Mask question doesn't violate any of the legal problems about testifying in the court. Need to say, Jiminy, he was a first-time supporter on your case against those_ Humanity First _nuts. This make us think if our tangos are an anti-breakthrough militia."_

_"Maybe."_ said Jiminy _"But they are not against use Vernetech: they had ornithopters. And where were the Super-Police from this district."_

_"This is the problem: this is a special no-breakthrough district. Need to say that is the most moronic idea all the time. The ones who had it will be an IgNobel nominee for sure. We have super-criminals, we need super-police."_ said Jeff.

_"Alright... LionHeart, is that the normal place where you did your parole meeting?"_ said Jiminy

_"Yeah."_ said LionHeart, flexing a little his arms to see for spraining and so. _"He was always afraid about his security."_

_"Well..."_ thought Jiminy _"Looks like they had internal support. But we need to deal with we have now, and we think later on the no-breakthrough thing. Jeff, Suzan, put all speedsters and flying capes from the police you can to search East Side. If you have any Metamorph that can change into aquatic animals, put them at the East Side for action. I think they are trying to get away. LionHeart, how are you?"_

_"Hurted and sore, but I'll live. The shooter was either a Star Wars Stormtrooper or wasn't trying to hit me directly. If so... Maybe the question would be the biggest piece of me you would find"_ said LionHeart. RPGs, specially HEAT ones, are enough power to put an Ajax like him down easily. _"Need just to put my costume."_

_"Okay... I'll give some support from air and also try to find him. And forget the costume, LionHeart, we have no time and we don't know what they want for real. So, you go CAI under Civil! I assume the responsibility!"_ said Jiminy

_"Be careful, Jiminy. Sounds like those punks are business."_ said Jeff

_"We are too. As we say: they brought the Foxtrot... Now they'll dance."_ said Jiminy, getting back to the heli

_"Why didn't you said about the intel?"_ said Blue Fairy.

_"How could I say them:_ Hey, look, I have this cyber-pixie into my head that can access a database from the Big Bad Teatime Anarchist and she saw that those guys wants to put New York City against breakthrough once and for all." thought Jiminy, while they got back to the helicopter.

_"So, the only thing we know is that those punks are going to East Side?"_ said Callisto

_"There's lots of hiding places there: even The Event destroying lots of the warehouses there, there's still too many of them."_ said LionHeart

_"Any gang?"_ said Jiminy

_"Not of anti-breakthrough people. Maybe those are some radical dissidence from_ Paladins _or something else."_ said LionHeart, while getting into.

_"Let me see something before we go."_ said Presto, doing some magical passes _"Where are those guys?_ VISION!" he said, closing his eyes...

_"They are... I can see... I hear something about the Statue of Liberty... And cleansing... And a new American Age."_ said Merlin, opening his eyes. _"looking they will try to do something with that guy and then run to International Waters. They want to publish some manifesto... They look like totally anti-government."_

_"And, if I'm right,"_ said Callisto _"They'll do it at the Statue of Liberty."_

_"Any group that could be doing this?"_ said LionHeart

_"Maybe some crazy nuts like the Pure God Work Fraternity."_ said Jiminy, remembering the KKK-wannabes that attacked him when he was just visiting a partner on a clown school at a hospital. He fired the engine back and then talked to radio

_"Nevada-Yankee-Hotel 02 to Dispatch. We are going for the Statue of Liberty. We have a hunch that the tangos are going there."_

_"Dispatch here, Nevada-Yankee-Hotel. Don't engage the tangos, as they have a hostage."_ said someone on Dispatch

_"Here is Jiminy Cricket, with LionHeart, Ajax, under Civil; Callisto, photo-kinetic; and Presto, a Merlin sidekick."_ said Jiminy _"Our plan is try to get ahead and wait the tangos there. I believe they are using some boat, maybe even a sub, to get at the Statue of Liberty. Don't engage them: they have HEAT weapons, enough to almost drop our Ajax LionHeart dead. Just track them. I'll need free airspace."_

_"Airspace's still in lockdown, Nevada-Yankee-Hotel. You have freeway till it. Godspeed and good luck."_ said Dispatch

_"Thanks."_ said Jiminy, cutting the radio off _"Hope they doesn't see us!"_

_"I can assure this!"_ said Callisto, holding her hand in the helicopter floor, when Jiminy started to feel like he was under a kind of spell or something like this _"I'm changing the refraction factor on all the matter external of the heli: they will not see us. I can't warrant they'll not notice a kind of flick in the sky, but it's the best I can do by now."_ she said

_"Great, Callisto."_ said Jiminy, pushing the power lever and flying as fast he can _"Blue Fairy, any route you can give for us?"_

_"Straight ahead!"_ said her _"To the second star to the right, and straight on till morning!"_

_"Stop clowning around, Shelly!"_ he said _"We have a big problem here!"_

_"Sorry Jiminy."_ she said

_"Don't go over-pressured."_ said LionHeart, looking for Jiminy

_"We need to deal with this now... Or they'll do something with that parole officer and this will not be good at all."_ said Jiminy.

_"I know... But the last thing we need is you pushing yourself too hard. We need you 100%, not 1000%."_ said LionHeart.

Jiminy thought on what he was doing...

_"Sorry everyone..."_ said Jiminy 

_"It's okay: being the leader is not easy task."_ said LionHeart _"Focus on the situation, stay calm, stay sharp, and let us help you."_

_"We are getting nearby the Statue... Looks like the tangos are already there!"_ said Jiminy, as the saw a submarine next it.

_"RPG!"_ yelled Blue Fairy, when Jiminy just put the lever enough to just get away from it.

_"Callisto, you're our flyer. Go on them while I land the heli. Presto, magical support for Callisto! Defensive magic on your discretion! LionHeart, ready for rock and roll!"_ said Jiminy, pushing the lever to do the fast landing he trained so dearly with Cabby at the simulator, and he did it nice and smooth, while Presto already ready some magical missiles he shot as soon he got out the heli, hitting one of them straight in the chest.

_"They have the higher ground, and our only flyer is Callisto."_ said LionHeart 

_"And the SPAT team will take time, according what Blue Fairy passed me."_ complimented Jiminy

_Superhuman Powers and Tactics_, SPAT for short, are the main tactical team New York City used. Differently from CAI-teams, SPAT are more focused on crime-fighting and public security then into support on crisis.

_"Alright. Callisto, any symbol or something that identify them?"_ said Jiminy via Earbug, while Presto shot some extra Magic Missiles.

_"Something Nazi... With the Stars and Stripes, stylished under the Nazi colors."_ said Callisto

_"Shucks! The Pure God Work Fraternity!"_ said Jiminy.

_"Those morons again?"_ said LionHeart

_"Looks like. And, if they are now strong enough to have internal intel on a place like police, certainly they are growing popular."_ said Jiminy.

_"Jiminy, SPAT said we have just the time until they arrive to deal with things, and then they'll bring Havoc Protocols!"_ said Blue Fairy.

_"Okay."_ said Jiminy for the others _"We have ten minutes, or SPAT team will arrive and hell will break loose for sure."_

_"So, let us deal with them."_ said LionHeart, snapping his fingers, ready for action.

## Chapter 9

> _"The Statue of Liberty action was something really, really, stressful: they knew we could not act straight against them without consequences. They gloated themselves as Freedom Fighters, heroes from common people. However, in the end, they were nothing more or less than terrorists, no better then the Caliphate guys. But we needed to fight them without dance the Foxtrot, as soon as possible."_
>
> **LionHeart, _"Life under a Super-Parole"_**

_"I'll try to gain time: Presto, go as support for LionHeart. Callisto, get out. I'll try to negotiate."_ said Jiminy

_"Roger!"_ said Callisto, while LionHeart and Presto run, avoiding machine gun shots and Jiminy got back to the Heli. He turned on the speakers, and he took the radio mic.

_"Hey, you!"_ said Jiminy, getting out the Heli. _"If you wanted to deal with us, you should go for us! Didn't you learned?_ Pretty Plea..."

It was when Jiminy felt his _Bellax Analytica_ engaging just a split second before a HEAT powered RPG being shot against the helicopter. He rolled away and just felt some of the shockwave from the blast, that turned the helicopter into half a ton of melting steel.

_"JIMINY!"_ LionHeart screamed.

_"I'm okay!"_ he said, tumbling in the ground, avoiding the machine gun shots, his _Bellax Analytica_ showing him where they would hit some split seconds before. _"They are not for talk. And my_ Bellax Analytica _shows they want to go full power against us. So, we'll need to fight our way through them to rescue._ Rules of Engagement _still applies until otherwise, though. We'll deal with them. Specially you, LionHeart, as you're under Civil, stay compliant on this!"_ said Jiminy _"Setting the_ Cricket Pistols _for stun. Every one, ready yourself. Sounds like they are prepared to deal with any kind of capes_, including Ajaxes. _We don't want to escalate things, but at the same time we should not play naïve with them! LionHeart, Callisto, on front to tackle them out of way as fast as possible. Presto, as much defensive spells you can do! Non-lethal attacks if you need! Drop as much of them unconscious as you can. I'll be nearby you to help! Go go go!"_ said Jiminy, running nearby Presto.

They started to climb the Statue's stairs up, fighting the Pure God Work Fraternity's minions: they were good armed, but they doesn't had combat experience, and even Callisto and Presto being working with Jiminy on a emergency, they were powered enough and know enough the basic strategy to deal with those small fish.

In the past,  as a chubby kid, Jiminy would be panting, but he had already lost some of the kid chubbiness, albeit he wasn't still a Mr. Universe. Now he was able to deal with running and so, readying himself to shoot, using either his _Bellax Analytica_ and some training he did under Soldaire and some guys from Scotland Yard and BKA, or _Bundeskriminalamt_, the Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office. 

_"Need to say, Jiminy, Soldaire would be proud!"_ said LionHeart, punching some guys, while Jiminy shot other guys almost on a one shot, one down ratio

_"Right..."_ said Jiminy _"But let us try to recover Mr. Menard ASAP... Sounds they had really great and up-to-date intel about your parole. They knew about me, so, unless some of them is a fanatic breakthrough data hate-reader, they had intel about who were going to be your HSF escort as parole."_

_"Okay... Let's go!_ Blue Fairy, _had you saw all those guys? Any intel?"_ asked Jiminy

_"Beside being 4chan supporters, right-wingers and haters... Nothing. They are not catalogued at_ TA's Future Files _or_ Ourobouros Files, _so they are small fish. But I have a hunch: I got some intel looking on some Dark Net sites, with a little help from my sisters, and got some intel on the_ Pure God Work Fraternity. _And their big kahunas are more or less linked each other."_ she said int Jiminy's head

_"Seems legit. Any potential leader or target we should be wary on?"_ thought Jiminy

_"There's a guy... Curiously, he lived in Newark last year, until the earthquake: Joseph Smith Williams, Jr. His father died during the super-heist spree at The Event aftermath. He was a cop and was killed by a super powered bank robber called_ Shaytan, _or at least one of the 4,237 morons that got under this capename until now._ Our Shaytan _killed Joseph Smith Williams, Sr. when he was on duty on a bank robbery. He literally ran through him: C-Class Metamorph, Ajax and Speedster. Small fish for breakthroughs, but a hell of a big fish for common cops. He could run very fast, change his arms into metal blades and literally splitting people in two using both his speed and the Ajax strength. Gross!"_

_"So Joseph Smith Williams, Sr was a cop and was killed by a crazy breakthrough. And the son?"_ said Jiminy

_"The son got to Army, and got to SEALs, but seeing he would never be in the same league of the MaxSEALs, the new super-powered elite military, he grew disgusted and turned into a survivalist tutor, teaching shooting and martial arts. It was when he became a_ Paladin _, leaving them some time after to create a militia against breakthroughs. He posted into some forums that they should be more active after the action they did last year that you stopped."_ said Blue Fairy

_"Any personal grudge between him and mr. Menard?"_ thought Jiminy, while they still were halfway to the crowd.

_"Indeed... Mr. Menard was listed under a_ blacklist/target list _for the Fraternity. As a vocal cape supporter, and as a cop, he was saw as part of, sic_, 'a corrupted system that thrown out the REAL Americans for the globalist swines.' _To be fair, a lot of balderdash, and the only one I can say without needing to soup my mouth after,. They were under an event about Breakthrough police enforcement some months ago, and things just didn't got rough because people intervened, they almost getting into a fistfight.."_ said Blue Fairy

_"Alright... So, there's a personal component on all this. Okay... This changes everything."_ said Jiminy, when there was just some stairs left.

_"What we should do?"_ said Presto

_"Callisto, Presto..."_ said Jiminy _"I don't think we can negotiate with him, at least without bring his henchmen down before. So, first of all you use some light powers to whiteout them enough we can knock them out. Then... I'll see if we can do something about it."_ 

_"Right!"_ said Presto and Callisto, readying some light powers and going up the stairs.

Jiminy could only see the flashing lights they shot and hearing the screams. He gulped, thinking he did a disaster, but entered the Statue's crown, shooting some of the henchmen with his _Cricket_ pistols, stunning them enough to make them get down. LionHeart punched some of them to knockout, when Jiminy saw Mr. Menard and a guy, using the same uniform he saw the year before, the same Nazi pastiche he dealt before. He had an AR-15 on his hand and he was pointing it to Mr. Menard. Jiminy pointed his Cricket pistols and said.

_"Down! It's over, Williams! SPAT is coming!"_ said Jiminy

_"You're dumb, kid! SPAT can't do anything here. This is a federal site!"_ said the man. gloating to catch Jiminy offhand

_"He's right!"_ gasped Blue Fairy _"NYC police can't do anything here without federal authorization. And I don't think Touches Clouds would give an authorization now: only if things escalates Himalaya-level she would give in."_

_"No matter."_ said Jiminy _"You are the one who kidnapped and is putting someone under a gun. This is enough for attempted manslaughter!"_

_"Pfah!"_ said the guy _"Manslaughter? He's not a man for a start! He's part of an oppressive system! He's a dog of corrupted guys that didn't did anything against the real danger, the so-called capes, before anything! Capes are just_ chicanos _or_ negroes _that use the so-called capes to do their mess!"_

_"Are you sure? Do you know me?"_ said Jiminy, taking out his mask _"I'm the kid that stopped you last year!"_

_"So, you're the pesky kid that send Maurice to jail."_ said the man, with a smirk _"So, let us see: first of all, drop your weapons, including the ones on your gloves, and your cane. And the brick with you, I want him under Blacklocks."_ said him, throwing a pair of Blacklocks. _"This is non-negotiable: don't do that, and the brains of this guy will decorate here."_

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy, dropping his weapons and removing his gloves. He looked for LionHeart, that gave him a little frown, but nodded. He took the Blacklocks and, even being very heavy for him, he put it on LionHeart's wrist.

_"Okay... So... What you want?"_ said Jiminy

_"And no powers: no magic, no lights, no_ Pretty Please_s, no nothing."_ said the guy

_"I can only talk about us."_ said Jiminy, while he thought _"Blue Fairy, send this to your sisters, and if you can, to_ HSF _and_ SPAT."

_"Right!"_ she said, now dressed as a camerawoman, with a video-camera over her virtual shoulders.

_"Not that easy! I know you have contact with Dispatch. Make clear that if someone from SPAT came here, you all will die!"_ he said, pushing a detonator. _"They came, it'll be a signal that the government gone corrupt to the core, and America had already be invaded by the globalists! So this statue would be a rotten symbol, and should be destroyed!"_

_"He is totally nuts!"_ said Blue Fairy. _"Should I send this for SPAT?"_

_"Yes!"_ thought Jiminy _"They need as much intel we can provide on the situation!"_

Jiminy focused on his _Bellax Analytica_ and the situation was grim, almost all the futures resulting on Mr. Menard, or him and his team, or both being killed. But he saw a potential way. It would be a dangerous gambit, though, specially for him... He trusted his power, and he trusted his experience under this kind of situation, including his first encounter with the _Fraternity_ and the time with Alsyf Alayat.

_"Hey... He's not useful for you... I'm a more useful target!"_ said Jiminy, and the others gasped _"You can have me, if you want, but_ Pretty Please!, _release him!"_ he said, using his _Pretty Please!_ on a calculated, trained, non-chalantly tone to pass over unsuspected on his talk. Jiminy knew that he needed to play with the guy's anti-cape prejudice: a target like Jiminy would be a juicy morsel than a common cop, and a safer one. Even that guy knew that, as soon he killed a cop, he would be hunted by all the good capes, vigilantes and cops, supers or not.

_"Okay, come here! You, you piece of shit, just get out!"_ he said, pushing the Menard guy in front, but the weapon still pointed for it.

Jiminy was almost to use the _Pretty Please!_ to deal with the guy, but he forgot one of the _Bellax Analytica_ caveats as a power: it was not a _fortune telling_ power, but a future evaluation one.

He can't foresee too much the moves from other people if he expands the future time slice he can foresee. And he needed to see if HE could be able to deal with the man, but he forgot to foresee the _others'_ actions.

As soon he was pushed, Mr. Menard run back to grapple the guy. He was surprised enough to not shoot immediately, but things escalated quickly.

As soon Mr. Menard got near, the guy brought the gun back, but LionHeart was already advancing against the guy, while both Callisto and Presto were working some shields to protect all them. Just a split second before the guy could target either LionHeart and Mr. Menard, LionHeart launched himself against LionHeart, what made the guy freaked out enough to shoot against him, making LionHeart fell in the ground, screaming. Mr. Menard got back, avoiding the shoots, using the cover LionHeart provided to run back.

Jiminy run fast enough to take back the _Cricket_ pistols and gave some shots, two of them straight the guy head. He saw the guy falling like a potato bag...

_"Jiminy!"_ shouted someone and she looked around. It was Suzan the Ajax cop.

_"Jiminy, go for LionHeart!"_ shouted in his mind Blue Fairy.

Jiminy got till there: LionHeart was screaming, bleeding. Even an A-Class Ajax, the depleted uranium shot, even into the shoulder, provoked lost of punishment. Jiminy run into his pack for a special patch that could stanch the bleeding for some time until a EMT came. 

The cops came and looked for the guy and then for Jiminy.

_"Jiminy Cricket, it's sad, but we need to say: you're under arrest on manslaughter!"_ said Jeff the cop

_"Wha..."_ was saying Jiminy, when he noted what he did.

He shot the guy dead, parts of his brain out of his head splattered all around.

The overload of things for his brain to process made Jiminy puke out beside LionHeart, trembling and almost freaking out, when Suzan came and put the Sandman bag over his head, making him go asleep.

## Chapter 10

> _"We are weapons, in the end. All breakthroughs are weapons. Our powers can result on deaths, in a way or another, by action or inaction. No matter if we kill by our own hands, or we kill indirectly, by shooting or saying to shoot. Sometimes, I think that for us, Ajaxes, it's easy to deal with this fact: we can kill by our own hands, so we need to deal with this dark truth all time. Other breakthroughs, like Vernes, Merlins and so, tends to suffers on this even more, as their actions normally can be used without so big fatality risks, so they doesn't need to deal with this fact all the time. But when you see a kid dealing with the fact he killed someone, even on duty... It's a heartbreaking thing."_

> **LionHeart, _"Life under a Super-Parole"_**

Joshua was sat into the cell: even he having no super physical prowess, he was put into a super-cell. He was with a emaciated  pale face, red eyes on crying, dressed into a default white shirt and orange pants for prisoners. He didn't ate or slept too much. For him, worse than being on jail was to think he _killed_ someone. Even a criminal, even trying to save people and not escalating people, a kill was a kill.

_"So you're Joshua McCarthy?"_ said someone outside the Vernetech force-field that somehow was used in the cell. He nodded meekly looking for the one that asked.

The man outside had a big, rounded belly, like Santa or  Friar Tuck from _Robin Hood_ for Joshua. He was using the typical Catholic Cassock, and had a little smile. He was holding a small brown paper parcel on a hand and an opened pack of Double Stuffed Oreos at the other. A local guard, that Joshua knew was a B-Class Ajax, opened a space in the Vernetech cell energy field, by hitting some buttons at a panel. 

_"Can we talk a little?"_ said the man, entering the cell

_"No problem."_ said Joshua, a little contemptuous, when the man came and sat in the other cement haddock in the other side of the cell, while the guard closed the cell again.

_"To be honest, the one who asked me to came said you were a cheerfully little boy."_ said him

_"Who are you? And who sent you?"_ said Joshua, a little more contemptuous. Jiminy was totally out of the mood for anything in the last days, so he was not too much for talking.

_"I'm Father Nolan, from Chicago's Saint Christopher's Church. The one who sent me said you're Catholic and that you were feeling really bad, needing help. The one who asked me to be here can't be see, but always looks for you."_ said the man

_"And, there's the tip, it was not Jesus!"_ said Blue Fairy, giggling. For the last four days, after the arrest, Joshua didn't talked with Blue Fairy. He used his call to ask HSF NYC HQ to ask someone to go with Presto and LionHeart back ORSL 1 and to update everyone on his situation. He didn't even talk with his mother and father, as he knew that, as soon NYC HQ passed the information about Joshua arrest for Soldaire, he would pass it for his parents.

_"Alright... So it was you, Blue Fairy."_ said Joshua, sighing. 

_"Now, don't be mad with your little cyber-angel. She asked for some help, as she knows you are really down."_ said Father Nolan. _"As she's connected with their sisters, Shelly Boyar and Shell, she asked them help. It was, in fact, Shell that came to me and ask for help."_

_"Sorry... I don't want to be rude and so, but unless you're a lawyer there's nothing you can do by now."_ said Joshua

_"I'm the one to be sorry, but I_ really _have help to you."_ said Father Nolan _"You see, I also forgot to say that I'm the_ Chicago Sentinels' _chaplain. Unofficially, of course."_

_"I understand this, but..."_ said Joshua, when Father Nolan stopped him with a small gesture.

_"I know what you can do: in fact, I'm really impressed with your history. Henry was a wise man to provide me some reports on your powers and actions and background. I know what happened at the Statue of Liberty..."_ said Father Nolan

_"So, you know I killed someone... You know I'm a..."_ said Joshua

_"You're_ not _a murderer."_ said Father Nolan, suave _"I'll just ask a question: how did you feel when discovered it, that the man you tried to stop was killed?"_

_"I couldn't believe I killed him: you see, I thought I set my pistols to_ Stun, _as by our protocol, not to_ Hurt _or_ Kill... _I... I..."_ tried to say Joshua, but it was when he snapped. He started to cry like a kid.

_"I know..."_ said Father Nolan _"You see, being friends with Blackstone is an honor and a privilege, that come with some responsibilities. When Shell asked me help, she downloaded a copy of the action video Blue Fairy sent to them for me to see. From what I saw, I think you were trying to gather intel and register your action."_

Joshua nodded.

_"Then, you tried that gambit to exchange yourself on Mr. Menard, right?"_ said Father Nolan, and Joshua nodded again. _"If I understood, you used that power you call_ Bellax Analytica _to find a way to reduce casualties and still acquire that crazy Fraternity guy, right?"_

_"Yeah... But... How could I..."_ said Joshua

"'But He said to them: "It is not yours to know the times or the moments, which the Father has set by his own authority. But you shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit, passing over you, and you shall be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the ends of the earth."' _This is Acts 1:7-8, and it was said when the apostles and disciples asked him when he would free Israel from the Roman oppression. But they didn't understood that there's nothing to him to try to anticipate things and to force God to do their wishes and change Fate. Here, eat some, you'll fell yourself better"_ said Father Nolan, showing him the Oreo package. Joshua took one and start to nibble.

_"As I saw, you tried your best, but things had gone havoc. Maybe you failed in the worst moment. This kind of thing happens with everyone. It's not pretty. It's never easy to deal with. But happens. You should not blame yourself on this: you are trained on this, and very well, as far I saw, but you are imperfect as everyone."_ he said

_"But when I fail, people can die! I was remembering all the actions I had and how near on them people were to die. My failures don't result in damages only! People can die..."_ said Joshua

_"But how many people_ had _died? And how must would die if you didn't acted..."_ said Father Nolan

_"This is no excuse."_ said Joshua _"I killed someone!"_

_"Yes... But... Remember that Our Lord Jesus had died in The Cross, with two criminals, and He pardoned them."_ said Father Nolan _"I think that he would pardon you because, and I hope I'm not wrong, you didn't_ liked _to kill, right? I can say you don't accept the_ it was my job _trump to relieve your conscience on what you did, even this being right. Am I right?"_

_"Yes... I try to sleep, but... I can see my hands in sleep... Blood red!"_ said Joshua, crying again, and again Father Nolan hugged him

_"Hush, hush, boy... It was nightmares. It's okay to have nightmares, as long you either don't let them consume you or you don't revel on them."_ said Father Nolan, again looking for him 

_"Sometimes, people need to do things they don't want. Sometimes, things goes havoc. That guy was playing a dangerous dance to deal with you, and unfortunately things had gone south. But you are not guilty on blood, at least under Our Savior, because you didn't_ want _to do it, you didn't_ like _it, you didn't_ revel _on death._ 'The thief does not come, except so that he may steal and slaughter and destroy. I have come so that they may have life, and have it more abundantly.' _From John, 10:10"_ said Father Nolan. 

_"I understand, but..."_ said Joshua

_"It's okay, Jiminy Cricket."_ said Father Nolan, talking his capename while Joshua was on civil _"It was like Astra when she dealt with Seif-Al-Din. She didn't felt okay with that. She knew that, even killing Seif-Al-Din, this would not bring back Atlas, Ajax, Nimbus. And she didn't_ revel _on killing. I heard somewhere that the worst on his first kill is when people starts to_ relativize _death, as there was people that_ deserves _to be killed._ 'You have heard that it was said to the ancients: 'You shall not murder; whoever will have murdered shall be liable to judgment.' But I say to you, that anyone who becomes angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment. But whoever will have called his brother, 'Idiot,' shall be liable to the council. Then, whoever will have called him, 'Worthless,' shall be liable to the fires of Hell.' _Again, this is Matthew 5, 21:22. And, I need to say, this also applies to those who thinks some people_ deserves to die, _no matter what."_ he said

_"It's not from now, but from sometime, that people mismatch Justice with Vengeance. And I see that, in those, the Buddhists and Hindi have some reason, because Jesus came to do this: to break the rage cycle, the vengeance cycle._ 'You have heard that it was said: 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, do not resist one who is evil, but if anyone will have struck you on your right cheek, offer to him the other also. And anyone who wishes to contend with you in judgment, and to take away your tunic, release to him your cloak also. And whoever will have compelled you for one thousand steps, go with him even for two thousand steps. You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and you shall have hatred for your enemy.' But I say to you: Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you. And pray for those who persecute and slander you. In this way, you shall be sons of your Father, who is in heaven. He causes his sun to rise upon the good and the bad, and he causes it to rain upon the just and the unjust. Therefore, be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect."' _Again, this is Matthew 5, 38 to 41 and 43 to 45 and 48."_ said Father Nolan

_"Looks like you memorized the versicles you needed to talk with me."_ said Joshua, smiling meekly

_"Occupational Hazard. And_ now _we have you back to your own."_ said Father Nolan, looking for the smiling Joshua _"In fact, I knew you understood this: God didn't gave you powers to_ kill, _but to_ protect. _But we all are imperfect, and we always can fail in the worst times. I know that failures when you are a cape can result in casualties: remember, I'm_ Chicago Sentinel's _chaplain, so I was the one that did the funeral mass for Ajax, Atlas, Nimbus. I had become spiritual counselor for Astra and, between us, to all of them, even Chakra, that is a Hindi. And when Jesus says_ "Therefore, be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect", _he wasn't saying this on_ if you are not compliant with Father's perfection, you're going straight to Hell, _but_ Look: I know that you're imperfect and the perfection seeking is a big of a burden. Do your best, improve every day and don't look aside. _He hopes we do our best and we don't revel on the evil and on death. Like Yoda says when Luke Skywalker says the Dark Side being stronger:_  “No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.”" said Father Nolan

_"I don't know why this..."_ said Joshua

_"It's easy to be tempted to deal with problems by trying to tackle them down as fast and strong they doesn't problems anymore."_ said Father Nolan _"But this is the catch: they_ still _are problems. You didn't solved it, you didn't coped it, you just shoved it aside, probably with even more resentment, anger..."_

_"That leads to hate..."_ said Joshua

_"That leads to suffering."_ replied Father Nolan. _"Looks like you're not just a Disney fan kid."_

_"I heard this a lot and saw_ Star Wars." said Joshua

_"Now... You know you'll need to deal with the consequences of your actions, but I'm  here say you that things will get well somehow, and that you shouldn't be that grumpy or despair on situations like you are now."_ said Father Nolan _"You killed a man: that's a fact. Maybe you did some great mistake, and you're suffering on your heart on this. But, by what I saw and by what we talked, I can say, and_ that _is the point, you_ don't revel in killing. _You still have your conscience, that little Jiminy Cricket inside you that says that_ killing is wrong, PERIOD. _No_ but_s_, however_s_, anyway_s. Killing is killing. Remove this from you, remove_ this _Jiminy Cricket, and you'll be no better than Seif-Al-Din or Alsyf Alayat or any of those guys that thinks that, after the breakthrough, they gone the_ Nietzschean Übermensch, _the Super-man, beyond Good and Evil, forgotten and bereft from all morale and ethics to others. I don't know you, but I would not like to live on a world_ Might is Right _would prevail."_

_"I understand... This is the danger of_ nihilism." said Joshua

_"Now I understand what they say about your powers: you have a great mind, being sage beyond your age. But in heart and soul, you're still a kid, and this make you suffer. But suffering is not the end. Jesus suffered at the Golgotha, in the Cross, as a man in fear, screaming for God why He was forsaken in this pain and suffering, but in the end of his human, earthly life, he just said:_ 'It is consummated', _as said in  John 19:30. This will pass, and you'll be healed, and you learned, and you'll grow better in all senses. The nihilist would say, and pardon my french,_ f%$k off, _because for him suffering is a sin. But we understand that suffering is the bitter on the sweet of life."_ said Father Nolan, when the Ajax guy came.

_"Sorry, Father, but your visit time is over. I need you to leave, please."_ he said.

_"Alright, I almost already finished."_ said Father Nolan to the Ajax. Then, he looked back to Joshua _"This little parcel is some dibs I brought you from the_ Sentinels _to cheer you up. Don't worry, people had already looked them and is okay for you. And... I need to say that this is difficult for me, but... Take the Oreos. I liked them a lot, to a vice to be frank, but looks like you need them more than me now. And... Could we finish my visit here blessing you?"_ said Father Nolan

_"Sure."_ said Joshua, going into his knees, when Father Nolan said, laying his hands over Joshua's head.

_"Our Lord, help this small son of you in his troubles, free him from his burden and pardon his sins, so he can get back to action and help people with the Powers You conceded him for Your Glory. In the name of Your Son and Our Lord Jesus Christ."_ said Father Nolan

_"Amen."_ both of they said, and they finished with Our Lord.

_"Thanks, Father Nolan, and thank everyone at_ Sentinels _in my name."_ said Joshua, while Father Nolan crossed the Vernetech force-field and he he sat back in the haddock, a lot better than the visit started.

He opened the package and saw some trinkets: a _go_ board that was a gift from Shelly/Shell/Blue Fairy, a deck of cards branded with Blackstone crest, a copy of the Holy Bible and a small Scapulary (Father Nolan's gift, of course), some sweets and an almost mint-state copy of _Wizard of Oz_, 1st Edition, with a dedicatory by Ozma saying _"don't let the Nomes to take you down. Kindness is a powerful weapon, in the correct times and rightly used."_

He took some of the Oreos and sat, starting to read the _Wizard of Oz_ book, trying to relieve his mind from the Revision Board that would be soon.

## Chapter 11

> _"Any superhuman action that resulted in casualties or fatalities should be subject of a Review Board. The Board would be compounded by the involved cape(s) team leader (or his superior, if he is also subject of the Board), a local CAI-team representation, a local government representation, a superhuman registrar representation and a society representation, the last one being a breakthrough of recognized knowledge on the issues of the Board and untarnished reputation. They should review either the After Action Report and any and all proofs and testimony related to and then communicate the results to the cape(s) under the review, also communicating all the results to the local law enforcement and justice bodies."_
>
> **Interpol'_s protocols for Review Boards and After-Action Reports_**

Jiminy was already bathed and dressed into his costume, ready for whatever would happen with him. It was three days since Father Nolan came to the district where Jiminy was acquired, and in the meantime his parents and Sugarplum came to there.

_"They put your action under a Review Board, and they are reviewing it. Hope everything goes well: if they see you had done things wrong, they can even revoke your CAI license, even permanently. So, it would be no more Jiminy Cricket."_, she said, worried.

Jiminy was already ready, just waiting for his escort, as the Review Board would happen at the same building. It was when his parents came, with Sugarplum and two SPAT members, and he also saw Seven with them.

_"Mom, pops!"_ said Jiminy

_"Alright, darling!"_ said his mother _"Everything will end well."_ 

_"OK, Jiminy."_ said Seven _"We'll need to put some locks on you. It's protocol."_ 

_"Okay."_ he said, when the Ajax guard granted Seven access.

Seven came and put the handcuffs on Jiminy's hands.

_"Okay. Let's go."_ said Seven, in a non-chalantly tone, like he was going to Disneyland's Splash Mountain, not to a Review Board that could remove from Jiminy all he did in the last three years or so.

They got an elevator and into a big room. He was in front of the Review Board:

_"Review Board for the After-Action Report # HSF-20XX-19302, subject for the Action involving the kidnapping of Darius Menard by the Pure God Work Fraternity that resulted into the death of Joseph Smith Williams Jr. by Joshua McCarthy, capename Jiminy Cricket. After-Action Report filled by the same Jiminy Cricket. This Board Members are: Seiji Shirou, capename Soldaire, as Jiminy's team leader; Lieutenant Suzan McDaggert for the New York City Police, as local CAI representation; Agent Elijah Williams, from the Department of Superhuman Affairs, DSA, as government representation; Eleanor Sinclair, from_ Herós Sans Frontières, NYC HQ, _as superhuman Registrar representation; and  Henry Roix, capename Blackstone, from_ Chicago Sentinels, _as society representation. As clerk, Willian McIntyre, from NYPD."_ said the little guy with a salt-and-pepper hair and a face of a clerk.

Jiminy looked for the board, all of them in their best costumes. Soldaire just undone his helmet, but he was under his SolArmor. All the others in power suits and so.

_"Let us start to review the operation from the beginning..."_ said Blackstone, that was the one chosen as speaker. They looked for all the things he talked with everyone, even with Blue Fairy (that was listed as a Netrunner cape, which was REALLY weird), and double-checking all the action. Everything was smooth until it came to the Statue of Liberty.

_"Jiminy, why didn't you left the action command for capename LionHeart, as he was more experienced as a cape than you?"_ asked Agent Williams.

_"Sir, LionHeart is a cape under parole. In fact, as cited in the Report, all the action started when Mr. Menard was kidnapped, and he's LionHeart's parole officer. By putting him under command, we would risk being questioned on the fact he's a convicted criminal under the system. Any problem, no small we had, would be put under a severe scrutiny."_ said Jiminy

_"No more than what is happening now. However..."_ said Blackstone 

_"And about he acting on a CAI Under Civil situation? Why didn't you gave him time to gather his costume?"_ asked Suzan

_"As the tangos had a hostage, I thought we could not expense more time than needed. As LionHeart has no need of equipment, putting him on CUC could save us precious time."_ said Jiminy

_"Let us stay on the topic... You set your_ Cricket _pistols to Stun, right? The Maskcam is clear on this."_ said Blackstone, continuing the Report analysis.

Jiminy was hearing all of the report, growing tense as the event that called the Board was near and near.

_"So, you had him under gunpoint."_ said Williams _"Why didn't you shot straight on that time?"_

_"Sir, I knew, via_ Blue Fairy _intel gathering, that Mr. Williams, Jr and Mr. Menard had a grudge. He would shot for sure the hostage as soon I started to push the trigger. In fact, that was what my_ Bellax Analytica _shown me."_ said Jiminy

_"Alright. And you did the gambit, by offering yourself as hostage instead of Mr. Menard. What you had in mind?"_ said Blackstone

_"I thought on stay with my_ Bellax Analytica _engaged, just waiting a breach on his defenses or a moment of naiveness on him to put him down. In the worst case, I at least would save the hostage."_ said Jiminy

_"However, your_ Bellax Analytica _didn't showed Mr. Menard going against Mr. Williams, Jr. Why?"_ said Suzan

_"Ma'am, my_ Bellax Analytica _is a power that depends on two factors: time deepness and details. I chose to expand the time deepness so I could see if my gambit would warrant the hostage safeness and freedom."_

_"By doing, this, however, you lost details. And, if I understood correctly, this means you didn't saw Mr. Menard getting back and trying to attack Mr. Williams, Jr."_ she said

_"Yes, Ma'am. It was when this gone Foxtrot. To try to protect Mr. Menard, LionHeart put himself as meat-shield for him, even Mr. Williams, Jr armed with a AR-15, depleted-ammo gun, standard anti-Ajax weapon. I had gone and shot him as a way to neutralize him as a Tango."_

_"Had you changed the_ Cricket _pistols settings?"_ said Soldaire

_"No... I didn't!"_ said Jiminy

_"Because, and this is important here, the_ Cricket _pistols telemetry shown a setting change for this shot, from_ Stun _to_ Kill." said Soldaire, looking incisively.

As most super-weaponry or weapons used by capes, the _Cricket_ pistols had a kind of telemetry registry that shown every setting change and shot fired into a memory system on it. This was always made as an accountability on the weapon use.

_"I didn't changed the setting! I swear!"_ said Jiminy, starting to freak out.

_"In fact, I believe him."_ said Blackstone _"By what I read about the_ Cricket _pistols, there would be no way for him to exchange the settings without_ consciously _go and change the setting. This, in fact, is a good thing, as it acts as a safeguard to recklessness action. And the Maskcam doesn't show him looking to the setting system, what would mean he tried to change settings."_

_"Sure."_ said Soldaire _"The_ Cricket _pistols are designed similarly my own_ SolPistol. _You can only exchange settings by looking and turn the settings on, as a safety mechanism."_

_"But..."_ said Eleanor.

_"Sounds like we have a mystery here, but one simply solved."_ said Agent Williams. _"While processing the acquired_ Fraternity _members, we found a C-Class Telekinetic on them. He even tried to remove the Blacklocks, but wasn't able to. But, by what I saw, it would be sensible to think that that guy used his telekinesis to change the_ Cricket _pistol setting. Even it being a Vernetech pistol, almost one-of-a-kind, thinking that pushing the setting knob all the opposite position would result on the setting going from_ Stun _to_ Kill."

_"But why?"_ said Suzan

_"They had the interest to provoke an anti-cape feeling on population, so they could get into a way as Saviors of Country."_ said Blackstone _"We have the intel collected by Shell, and this is classified by now, of course, but we know that the_ Pure God Work Fraternity _is a dissidence from_ Humanity First, _more nationalist than racist: they are against_ non-US _breakthroughs. But Mr. Williams, Jr. specifically expanded their targets to those that worked with the government, that they think is lenient against their primary target of foreigner breakthroughs, and international NGOs. LionHeart and Jiminy Cricket  looked like a good side effect on their vendetta, as they works to_ Herós Sans Frontières."

_"And why they would kill their own leader?"_ said Suzan

_"By creating a martyr._ Crazy breakthrough kid kills American good citizen. _Put this headline on the correct groups on Internet and slow cook things: it is obvious that they would use Mr. Williams, Jr., quote-unquote, martyrdom as a way to show that breakthroughs that are not part of_ good citizenry _are evil. As a matter of fact, some ultra-nationalist used to have a periodical called_ The Good Citizen, _between 1913 and 1933. This kind of speak, easy and emotional, are staple on any system of disinformation and fake news, specially those focused on extremist  or fascist philosophies. It's not unlike the speaks from both sides at Cold War, or like some of the speaks from the Caliphate and, shame on us, our own government sometimes does."_ said Blackstone, as easy as he was lecturing everyone into trivia

_"So, the guy saw Jiminy taking back the gun and exchanged the setting to kill his own leader?"_ said Soldaire

_"Maybe..."_ thought Suzan _"Or he just changed the setting waiting for someone of his own take the gun or that Jiminy could kill some of his own as friendly fire. No matter what, he tried to somehow profit on the situation and thought that messing with the_ Cricket _pistols would be a good way to do this."_

_"So..."_ said Blackstone _"We could say that Jiminy hadn't_ on purpose _killed this man."_

_"This is clear..."_ said Agent Williams _"But it is still a kill: there's lots of pressure to give Jiminy some punishment."_

_"However, take his CAI certification, even temporally, would be overkill."_ said Soldaire

_"On the other side... if we just left Jiminy run free, people will call us lenient, and those crazy nuts like_ Humanity First _or_ Paladins _would go for our throat!"_ said Suzan

_"I think we had discussed this before..."_ said Blackstone _"And as the senior member of the board, I think I have the best solution for our situation."_ he said, looking for Jiminy

_"As you didn't_ purposefully _killed that man, the manslaughter accusation will be dropped and you will not be judged in the Court. Also, your CAI certification will not be revoked_ by now. _However,"_ said Blackstone, looking very serious _"I believe, and I think that my Board fellows agrees, that you were reckless on take action, and you should had waited for more information. We know that they had a hostage, but the fact is that you were reckless, even more taking action as team leader being so inexperienced as a cape. I don't want to just_ suspend _you, as we are also under social scrutiny: this review board will be validated by NYC Justice. So, your CAI certification is_ on hold, _with all implications on this, by the next three months."_ said Blackstone, and everyone gasped.

Jiminy was no strange to be under the knife with his CAI Certification: last year, he suffered a trial on attempted manslaughter. But that time, he was put on bench because of the PR. This time things were really serious. By having his CAI-Certification on hold, that means that he couldn't even be in the bench: it was even worse than being put as a sidekick or on bench because, on both situations, he could act as a cape in emergencies. Having it on hold means that he couldn't act even on a serious catastrophes, even if his own life was in danger.

_"After the three months hold, your CAI-certification will be revalidated via an Action Test, to be held under the Chicago Sentinel's Dome. The terms of this action test will be determined and send to you later. This Board will be the revalidation Board for this effect. If you fail to achieve the expected levels, your CAI-certification will be revoked, but, if_ Herós Sans Frontières _still wants you as cape, you can restart the CAI-certification process as a sidekick, after at least another 6 months period."_

This would be really harsh, thought Jiminy: he could be turned into a sidekick again if he fails the revalidation!

_"Everyone agrees? Jiminy?"_ said Blackstone

_"I have no talk on this. I agree."_ said Jiminy, resigned, while the Board agreed with this. Jiminy was so hopping mad if he was another kind of kid he would snap now and swear everyone in the room, but there was nothing he could do by now.

_"So, let us sign everything."_ said Agent Williams.

Jiminy tried not to think, and he signed his documents as best he could, but their parents and Sugarplum looked for the frustration on him. Blackstone also looked, but he tried to be as a dandy as he always was.

After they all got out of the room, Blackstone came to him:

_"I know you're frustrated... I'm this frustrated too... But we need to deal with all the external pressure on capes. This is not just PR or so: the anti-cape movements is growing and they'll try to put us against the corner. This could be enough to deal with this by now."_

_"I understand... Although I wouldn't say I'm liking it."_ said Jiminy

_"I would not ask you for this."_ said Blackstone, smiling _"But, and I have big hopes on this, you're a clever good kid, and in three months you'll be back to action. If you want some advice, take at least a week to put your hair down: you had under pressure for too much time. Even me would not be able to deal this all, and I'm an ex-SEAL, intelligence specialist, beside my powers."_

_"And I'm just the pesky hero-playing kiddo."_ said Jiminy, sighing

_"Beside the_ hero-playing, _the rest is true. Because you never_ played hero, _You always was a hero."_ said Blackstone, while his mother and father got to him. _"After that, study all the procedure manuals you can and ready yourself and train more your powers. Beyond everything, be ready and stay focused."_ said Blackstone, when Seven came to him _"Now, if you excuse me, mr. and mrs. McCarthy, Jiminy."_ said Blackstone, lifting the hat.

_"And now?"_ said Sugarplum _"As you're_ on hold, _you're not even part of our roster."_ 

_"Money will not be a problem."_ said Mrs. McCarthy _"We used Joshua's wage to pay the Geneva house's mortgage and we have our work, he would be not at need."_

_"But he can't use the communications lines with ORSL 1 or HSF."_ said Sugarplum _"He's like a civilian now, and civilians can't contact ORSL 1 via the comm lines."_

_"Well..."_ said Jiminy, while he had the handcuffs removed and his bag with civilian clothes that was held since his acquiring was returned to him _"Look I'll need to deal with this alone, at least until the revalidation test."_, he said while getting into the cell one last time to change into some civilian clothes.

## Chapter 12

> _"The Revalidation Process was something that really stressed me out: as I was_ on hold, _I had no way to practice: I was neither considered a sidekick. I saw and read all CAI procedure manuals I could put hands or take from Internet, from_ Chicago Sentinels _to_ Herós Sans Frontières _to_ Interpol _to_ Japan Superhuman Self-Defense Force. _I couldn't train, so the best way to ready myself is to gather all knowledge I could, focus on tuning my powers other ways and then hope for the best."_

_"Joshua, it's Seiji on the phone."_ said Mrs. McCarthy _"And come on. Time for dinner!"_

_"Right!"_ said Joshua, in his room at the second floor. He got down and took the telephone. _"Jiminy."_

_"Jiminy, it's Soldaire."_ said the man at the other end of the line. _"How are you?"_

_"Okay, or as far I can be now... Trying to see the glass half-full: I don't think I had a dinner with my parents since the time after the Process last year. But I'm still worried with the Revalidation."_ said Joshua

_"It's just about this I'm talking about: they send me an email with the Revalidation Test terms and I've already approved. I forwarded it to you and I want you to look them and confirm it ASAP, because of some of the caveats on the test."_ said Soldaire _"I'll be there also, as I'm part of the Board."_

_"Okay... I'll look it after dinner."_ said Joshua, calling the call off and getting into the dinner room on his home at Geneva, Switzerland.

_"What Seiji wanted with you, Josh?"_ asked Mr. McCarthy, while he and his mother placed the table and he finished him some fish and rice.

_"It's about the Revalidation Test. They sent me the terms for it... Think I'll study it after the dinner: sounds like they need me to answer it ASAP, maybe they need me to know if I need some asset or so."_ said Joshua.

_"Alright. So, let us eat, and then you can go."_ said Mrs. McCarthy, while they sat for eating.

After the food, Joshua took a small thermos with some chocolate milk and got it back to his room. After a quick shower, he put some of his Jiminy Cricket pyjamas from Disney and fired the email system on his common laptop. After logging in, he saw the email from Soldaire. He looked it and saw that it was in fact a forward one from <blackstone@chicago-sentinels.cai>.

He saw that there was a document attached on the email, that he downloaded and opened, starting to study it. After some minutes, he closed it and stored it encrypted into his special Asimov-powered flash-drive. He then created an email and sent it to Soldaire and Blackstone with some information they asked him about on the document. He got to the bed, and looked to his costume, neatly placed in a hanger, like a prized item, thinking on if he'll be Jiminy Cricket after the revalidation, or he'll need to get everything from scratch, getting back to basics.

And then... He got to sleep.

---

A week later, he got with his parents to Chicago, to the Chicago Sentinels Dome, the big dome that was the base of the Chicago Sentinels. On the main gate of it, there was The Harlequin, an old time circus artist that turned into a living doll when she almost felt to dead at _Cirque Du Soléil_ during an acrobatics show. She was under her traditional harlequin costume and mask. The weirdest thing is how _glossy_ she looked around: it was like a living Barbie.

_"Hello Jiminy, Mr. and Mrs. McCarthy."_ said her, and people started to look those guys that _The Harlequin_ was receiving. They should be capes, or at least one. Joshua could feel some flashes from cellphones and photo cameras, making him blush, while The Harlequin shook hands with them. A guy or another, cape nerds for sure, pointed him, and they know that, even he on civil, he was Jiminy Cricket. She continued to talk while ushering then into The Dome.

_"I think we had saw each other before, but I never gave you my real name: I'm Jacquin Torres, and I'll take you to where will happen your Revalidation Test, Jiminy. Mr. and Mrs. McCarthy, there'll be some seats you can see him, but I need to ask you to avoid comments during the test, as you'll be next the Revalidation Board."_ she said, while they get in _"Tom, these are the McCarthys, and they'll have full guest clearance until further notice, alright?"_

_"Ma'am. Sirs."_ He said, taking some glances on the McCarthys and looking into their bags. 

_"Also, provide them some guest room. Even in the worst case, I think they could be given a day into it."_ said The Harlequin

_"Yes, ma'am."_ said the Tom guy, with a Droopy voice, while she conducted them to the elevator, while acting as a kind of tourist guide for them, until they got into the elevator. Jiminy could see it's not the "normal" elevator, but certainly one exclusive for the Chicago Sentinels: she looked to I kind of iris scanner  and so. They got into the elevator and start to get down.

_"We have lots of acquired artifacts that we need to be safe: the Dome is build to resist anything up to an Omega Attack. Even launching a nuke wouldn't be enough to compromise the Dome's structure enough to create security breaches. And we like to make this clear."_ she said, while the got out the elevator, she ushering through the corridor until open form them a special room, that looked like a big family room from some of the high-level Disney hotels, at least in comfort.

_"You'll take the night here after the Test. Things going okay, there'll be a little happy hour after the test. Jiminy, I think you brought your costume."_ she said, and Jiminy nodded. _"I want you to be ready in at most half an hour. All the assets you asked for the test, including your new costume, are ready, and you'll be presented to them at the right moment. Are you okay?"_ 

_"Yes... I think I can do it."_ said Joshua

_"Right. I'll be back soon. Be ready."_ said The Harlequin. While Mrs. and Mr. McCarthy unpacked their clothes, Joshua got to the bathroom to ready himself, taking a shower and after drying himself going for his bedroom, were a big cardboard box was his new costume.

He dressed carefully, looking for all the gizmos and checking everything: he chose to get into his normal _Jiminy Cricket_ costume, a fresh one with an extra gizmo he asked Dumont to do. He never tested it, though, and he hoped things would not go wrong in the worst time.

_"Son, are you okay?"_ said Mr. McCarthy, while Joshua got Jiminy.

_"As okay I can. There's nothing too much I can do, though. I'll do my best and hope things goes okay."_ said Joshua, or better, Jiminy, while finished to put his costume by placing his cricket shaped mask and Top Hat. He got out the bedroom and his parents looked to him. Her mother came and adjust his scarf cravat, when they heard a _knock knock_ on the door.

_"Jiminy? It's time."_ they heard The Harlequin saying, and they opened the door.

_"Now, let us go."_ said The Harlequin. They walked through a corridor until The Harlequin knocked another door. A guy that looked like the Tom guy from the entrance opened it, and Jiminy could see it was a kind of amphitheater, where his Revalidation Board were.

_"Now, Mr. and Mrs. McCarthy, please. You can see all the Test from here, but I'll ask you to avoid comments during the test."_ said The Harlequin

_"Go on, son. Everything will be alright."_ said Mr. McCarthy, while Mrs. McCarthy just lifted his mask a little and kissed him in the cheek.

_"Okay."_ said The Harlequin. _"Let's go."_

She take Jiminy to an elevator and she get into a special room with him.

In the room was already into their costumes Djanni, Presto, Sugarplum and Marjanah, into a generic sidekick costume, a white jumper with an overall and a dark green domino mask, a common  _hijab_ over her hair and a _niqab_ being used to somehow hide her face and provide her with a _secret identity_.

_"Jiminy, are you ready?"_ said Presto

_"As ready as ready I could be."_ said Jiminy

_"Doesn't sound too confident for me."_ said Sugarplum

_"Alright."_ said The Harlequin _"Some of our roster will fight against you."_ she said, passing some Earbugs _"Those Earbugs are into a special frequency: only you and the board will hear your talk. Obviously you will not be able to hear our side comms. Our roster will be under a kind of ninja black costume, so you couldn't identify who's who to difficult your planning. And, Jiminy, an order from Blackstone: Blue Fairy should not be consulted during the test. And I know she can see and hear me, I'll make it clear: you'll not join this one, right?"_

_"Cheesy!"_ said Blue Fairy, on a costume that remembered a Japanese preschooler, putting her tongue out.

_"Alright, Blue Fairy. We know that I need to do this by my own. And, I need to say, they'll have by sure Shell or Shelly at their side somehow to see if I not get for you."_ said Jiminy

_"Okay..."_ she said, getting out of Jiminy line of sight.

They saw the door opening and what's looking like a big basketball court. The intense white light was already there, and there's some flags over the other side. He could see four people on black ninja like costumes, and using black masks.

_"Welcome, Jiminy Cricket,"_ said Blackstone via the speakers in the room _"to the_ Sentinel'_s Danger Room, where we train some joint tactics for actions. As a Mastermind, your Revalidation Test will be focused on your tactical skills, but you'll be also attacked and your combat skills will be also looked upon. If you look around, you'll see that's some black ribbons. Each ribbon represent a hostage for our 'villains'. Your mission is simple: you need to rescue as much of the hostages from our villains in 20 minutes. Bonus points if, after the Test, you identify the capes that are our villains now, and points will be taken for each of your roster that fall in the combat. They have orders to not take easy on you, to take you out for sure if they have the chance. And, to turn things even more interesting,_ I'll _be the Supreme Overlord commanding my own minions. As you can see, there's four minions against five heroes... But will you be strong enough to defeat my Legions of Doom? BWAHAHAHAHAHA!"_ said Blackstone, when a counter showed over the room.

_"This was really cheesy!"_ said Marjanah

_"I believe that he always wanted to say that."_ replied Presto

_"Don't worry. We'll deal with them."_ said Djanni.

_"For sure."_ said Sugarplum

_"Be ready... As soon the counter starts to run, they'll came to us."_ said Jiminy.

The counter started to blink, and them the countdown started.

It was in a blink that one of the "villains" flew against Marjanah, trying to knock her out, being avoid by Sugarplum that made a special shield that made him get back.

_"Atlas-type... Sound like Astra... Or maybe Shell?"_ thought Jiminy, starting to coordinate the actions. _"Marjanah, Presto, reinforce our defenses. Sugarplum, magical ranged attacks at your discretion. Djanni, go for the hostages and tag all the tangos in the way!"_ said Jiminy, using his Jiminy cane to show them what to do

_"Roger!"_ said everyone, when Jiminy felt his _Bellax Analytica_ almost screaming. 

He tumbled aside just a second before someone him the ground... Leaving a small crater in the ground where he hit.

_"Yikes! Ajax... Maybe Metamorph. The worst is that they all are using black clothes, turning them almost undistinguished."_ thought Jiminy, when he felt his _Bellax Analytica_ engaging again. He felt a small bullet crossing the side of his face, the needle point almost touching his skin below his mask.

_"Okay... Sounds like we have the unknown Ajax/Metamorph, Astra/Shell and maybe... Artemis! She's a kind of Supernatural cape with Vampiric powers, but she fights with guns: maybe she has some narcotic ammo to knock us out as soon we are hit!"_ thought Jiminy, when he felt some cloud solidifying and a small pistol almost getting nearby him, a needle passing through his costume when the gun was fired. Jiminy took his _Cricket_ pistol and started to shoot, running through the room.

_"Presto, help Sugarplum and use your_ Magic Missiles _to split them! Marjanah, think one of them is a Vampire-like supernatural: use your mind-blasts to attack her where she's vulnerable!"_ said Jiminy, running.

_"Right!"_ said them 

_"Catched one of the hostages, but this pesky Atlas is difficulting things to us!"_ said Djanni, avoiding the Atlas attacks. 

_"Sugarplum..."_ said Jiminy

_"Sorry, hands full. Looks like the Tango other side is a Mentalist like Marjanah, but very experienced. She's helping the Ajax and I'm trying to debuff him as much as I can."_ said Sugarplum

_"Alright:_ Cricket Wings _engaging!"_ said Jiminy, hitting a small button on his shirt wrist. His tails opened like insectoid wings.

The _Cricket Wings_ were created by Dumont based on his _Demoiselle_ and were part of his _Iron Cricket_ costume, a combat focused costume he used during Derek Kwazani acquiring operation, and Jiminy asked Dumont to put them on his common tails. He took off and flown to nearby a place where there was some "hostages", taking the black piece of cloth, while the flying one was getting nearby. Jiminy set the gun for _Hurt_ and shot. He could hear the Atlas giving a yelp and flown down a little.

_"How much hostages we have?"_ said Jiminy 

_"I take one!"_ said Djanni

_"Me too!"_ said Sugarplum

_"Getting near another, but I need help!"_ said Presto

_"Marjanah?"_ said Jiminy

_"That Mentalist is very powerful, skilled and experienced! I'm in trouble to fight her in the Astral Plane! I'm doing my best, but I can't help you by now!"_ said Marjanah

_"Presto, I'm going to..."_ say Jiminy, when something tackled him, making him get down in the ground. It was the Ajax.

He felt some pain, but had time to roll his body outside the danger, still holding his cloth, and getting in his feet. He took his Jiminy Cane and hit him with the Taser, which made the tango scream and fall.

_"Alright..."_ he said, when he felt his leg wrongly...

_"I dropped one of them, this is good news. Bad news, I'm with a sprained ankle!"_ said Jiminy.

_"I'm going to you!"_ said Marjanah, doing what looked like a teleport _"Presto, gain me a minute or two!"_

_"Roger!"_ said Presto.

Marjanah got out the guy and lifted Jiminy's trousers leg.

_"Look like you really sprained your ankle this time."_ said Marjanah... _"I could make you some magical healing..."_

_"No..."_ said Jiminy _"Everyone, take the hostages to me. Marjanah and Presto, I want you to make our defense. Sugarplum, Djanni, you'll rescue the other hostages!"_

_"Roger!"_ said everyone

_"I'll expand as much I can my_ Bellax Analytica _and help you!"_ said Jiminy, focusing.

He had trained his _Bellax Analytica_ in the time he was on hold, and now he could preview between 2 to 5 seconds on actions. Time enough to turn his power useful in combat.

Sugarplum, Djanni and Presto gave him the cloths

_"Four hostages and we still have some time. Go go go!"_ said Jiminy, looking that there's passed 5 minutes

The problem is: the more "hostages" they took back, the more the tangos difficulted their lives. It took 7 minutes to rescue another 2 hostages, for six.

_"We are growing tired!"_ said Sugarplum 

_"Presto, change places with Sugarplum!"_ said Jiminy, almost beet red, sweating a lot. He never focused so much in battle on his _Bellax Analytica_, when he thought on a risky business

_"Sugarplum, Marjanah! Leave me now with the hostages!"_ said Jiminy

_"What? But..."_ said Sugarplum

_"I know, they'll came to me... And this is what I want!"_ said Jiminy

When Sugarplum and Marjanah got away, they started to come. Jiminy lifted using his Cricket Wings and flew away.

_"C'mon..."_ thought Jiminy, shooting the tangos with his _Cricket_ pistols and Tesla Arc Gloves and flying away. _"This_ needs _to work!"_

Seven minutes after, he heard what he wanted to!

_"Jiminy!"_ said Marjanah _"We rescued the remaining hostages! Come back! Me and Sugarplum will give you support!"_ said Marjanah

_"No! Stick to the plan!"_ said Jiminy, when he felt the tangos came to them

_"No!"_ said Jiminy, taking his hand and loading his Tesla Arc Gloves _"Sugarplum! Shield on max!"_ 

_"Roger!"_ said Sugarplum

Jiminy shot the Atlas straight in the chest with an all out shot to stop him. Then he felt his _Bellax Analytica_ alerting for a mind attack by the tango Mentalist, but he felt Marjanah came to him, and Presto did a good _Magic Missile_ shot to take him down.

It was when the countdown zeroed and an bell rang.

_"Alright... Sounds you did okay for us. But let us see: Jiminy, who were the Capes that were your tango."_ said Blackstone

_"Think that the mentalist was Chakra... There was also Artemis... And I think either Astra or Shell... The only one I didn't recognized was the Metamorph/Ajax."_ he said

_"It was a little cheat I did."_ said Blackstone _"He's Iron Jack, one of our veteran reserves. He can turn his body into steel, so growing extremely massive and hitting people hard. In fact, by surviving an attack of him without being an Ajax or other combat-focused cape is an honor, Jiminy."_

_"I think that this is enough."_ said Soldaire. _"Harlequin, please bring Jiminy and the others back us. I think we'll have a decision as soon they arrive."_

_"Alright."_ said The Harlequin _"I think you did well. Are you okay to walk?"_ said her, looking for Jiminy's ankle and help supporting his body while he supported his weight on the _Jiminy Cane_ as always.

_"Just limping... Think I fell over my knee into that attack from Iron Jack."_ said Jiminy looking to him _"Are you alright?"_

_"I'll live."_ he said _"Being hit by electricity is a bad thing, but I'll survive. Clever idea: as I'm metal, electricity is a bane for me."_

_"And now I see why Blue Fairy like you so much."_ said a voice a little robotic behind him _"I'm Shell, one of Blue Fairy's 'twins'. In fact, I just 'don' the Galathea suit as a 'remote operator', if you understand."_ said Shell, shaking her robotic hand with Jiminy. 

Harlequin ushered all of them for the same room his parents came before the Test. They entered and he saw the board, Soldaire on his best _Keichisou_ uniform instead of his _SolArmor_. Blackstone had a poke face and looked for everyone:

_"We had saw your actions, Jiminy Cricket. You still had sometimes gone reckless on some moments. If our 'villains' had gone really all out, maybe you could be defeated. They had orders to shoot or rip the 'hostages' cloths if they were rescued and they had a chance: this would be a person being killed."_ said Blackstone, and Jiminy gulped.

_"However, you acted as a great leader on this action: we did the Test setup on purpose, by not allowing you to take your original team's roster best guys for your Test team. All of you,"_ said Blackstone looking for all of them _"did very well, putting aside your common lack of combat experience. I like how you used Marjanah to fight Chakra back in Astral Plane and she reported me you, Marjanah, is a great Astral fighter. Presto and Sugarplum, you did a good job on supporting the team, even considering the lack of super-combatants on it. Djanni, you technique still lack some polishing, but you remembered me Astra or Atlas on their beginning. And you Jiminy, you did what you could, under pressure, even more after being hit by Iron Jack. You didn't falter and I think that you improved your_ Bellax Analytica _during the time on hold."_ said Blackstone.

_"So..."_ said Agent Milligan, DSA representative _"We are glad to say that your CAI-Certification was revalidated and, as the Revision Board for the After-Action Report # HSF-20XX-19302, we grant back to you, Joshua McCarthy, capename Jiminy Cricket, you CAI Certification, and with it the authorization to act as Cape under_ Herós Sans Frontières Situation 2 Team 10 _roster, represented here by the team leader Seiji Shirou, capename Soldaire. We acknowledge this by giving you back your Cape Crest."_ said Agent Milligan, while Soldaire took a small dark green button with the Disney's Jiminy Cricket head silhouette. 

After Soldaire pinned the crest back on the chest of his tails, Jiminy Cricket touched it like a very dear charm or amulet. He would never admit, but he avoided to think if he could lose this crest. He just came back to reality when Djanni gave him a so strong hug that almost left him without air or unbroken ribs. Sugarplum, Presto and Marjanah joined them, while he felt his Top Hat going to the ground and everyone there cheering and applauding him.

_"Now..."_ said Blackstone _"I think that you all are hungry from the effort you did on the test. I think we can get to our dining room for some fun and a happy hour. I believe that Grendel, Crash, Megaton and the others had just bought the last copies of_ Just Dance _and_ Street Fighter. _However, I think you'll want to take some bath before, to be more refreshed."_ he said, and everyone chose to take a bath before.

The fun and games were good, after being too much pressured on his test.

And Jiminy could say that the food tasted incredible. The taste of relief.

## Chapter 12

> _"We came back ORSL 1 in two days. Sure, we had lots of gifts: books, tools, supplies, even some videogames. But a hero's work never ends, someone said, and sooner than ever we discovered this."_

> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**


_"Jiminy, get out there!"_ said Sugarplum, when the weather suddenly changed to a furious torment.

_"No! We need to evacuate the refugees to Atlantis before the torment came. The others are in on a rescue mission in the middle of this torment. They need me!"_ said Jiminy... And he were looking for all the systems, seeing the screens for all the intel: radar, weather, comms, all the things. _"We need to light out things for them, so they can get back ORSL 1."_ 

_"I go..."_ said Sugarplum

_"NO!"_ shouted Jiminy _"Trying to fly will be dead for you! The tempest is strong and the winds fast: you can't fly into this weather. I'll go for the lighthouse. Stay into the evacuation!"_ he said, running from the control room. 

Just a split second after he got out the control room and got down the stairs to the platform deck, he felt a bout of wind and ran to hold himself into a steel bar fixed into another structure, locking a hook on his costume into it to avoid the bouts of wind.

It was what saved him: the bout of wind grew so strong that he saw the control room being blast away like Dorothy's house.

_"Sounds like our control room had gone to Oz, Sugarplum."_ said Jiminy

_"Alright! When we get out of this, we just need to ask Ozma to bring it back to us."_ said Sugarplum nonchalantly, which made Jiminy give that childish giggles he give sometimes and he felt ashamed of.

_"I'll go to the lighthouse!"_ said Jiminy

_"Take care: this doesn't look natural weather change."_ said Sugarplum

_"I will!"_ said Jiminy, running throught the platform, using his _Bellax Analytica_ to foresee bouts of wind, waves and water puddles that could make him trip. This would be fatal: he would be thrown in the raging sea, and even he survived the fall, there was the water and the sea.

It took some minutes until he got to the lighthouse, that was stronger than the control room, made with lots of steels pillars and so. He got up the ladder, avoiding the worst bouts of wind and entered the lighthouse.

_"I'm in. I'll light the lighthouse and then I'll go for the emergency war-room. You go for Atlantis with the refugees and so. I'll get there as soon I can, with the others"_ said Jiminy

_"Alright! Good luck and godspeed!"_ said Sugarplum, when he felt his Earbug goes mute, as Sugarplum was going down the sea via the elevator for Atlantis.

_"Jiminy, I'm looking for all intel I can about this with my twins!"_ said Blue Fairy, dressed as the Morton Salt Girl, virtually wet from the tempest. _"But it was a so sudden change that they are dealing with this as a possible Ultra Event."_

_"An Ultra weather-controller? That would be good other places..."_ said Jiminy

_"Yeah, but here they are just trying to damage the ORSL line."_ said Blue Fairy

_"What is known about the other ORSL bases? And about Transports 1 and 2?"_ asked Jiminy, while filling the generator tank with some diesel from a small gallon.

_"Sounds like the other bases were already evacuated, and they are under a better situation. Sounds like the worst was on us, and the others are finishing the rescue they did. I sent the intel for them that we are offline until further notice via our twins. Sounds like Blackstone is not happy to see Shell being use as telephone girl."_ she said

_"He knows we need this line as much as possible_ AND _I'll use it as much as need. No more, no less."_ said Jiminy, while puffing a little after igniting the diesel generator with an old-time flintlock. _"Yuck! This stinks!"_

_"But helps!"_ said Blue Fairy, as they saw the light being lit. _"Alright. Engage the rotation system and let us get out here!"_

_"Alright!"_ said Jiminy, pushing some levers and running back to the ladder.

He soon was out, and a wave hit him for good!

_"Are you okay, Jiminy?"_ asked Blue Fairy

_"My Hat had gone away, and my tails are almost going also, but I'm okay. I'll let it go: better lose the tails than the neck."_ said Jiminy, when another bout of wind take his tails. But he was able to get out the platform and close the trapdoor to external world. 

The normal lights were out, but the red lights from the Code Red were blinking all around. He was trained on all this, but this didn't mean he felt better, still feeling queasy. He ran as fast as he could, as the platform was being shaken like a rubber duck on a bathtub where a kid was into tantrum to not take his bath. 

He ran to the door he wanted and put a keycard into the lock and waited until it lit green. As soon it did, he entered and, while taking his gloves off, he started to engage some circuit breakers and starting everything. This room was not as equipped the one that gone to Oz, but had what he needed, and was supplied by a vernetech battery made by Vulcan.

Jiminy took away his soaked waistcoat and shirt:

_"You'll get a cold, Jiminy!"_ said Blue Fairy

_"There's the same chance to by staying with all those wet clothes!"_ he said, also taking away the mask _"No need for all this. At least I'll do things comfy!"_

_"Alright!"_ pouted Blue Fairy _"But when you take another penicillin shot, I'll say_ 'I warned you!'"

_"Hope we'll be alive to you say this!"_ said Jiminy, taking a headset and looking for the systems. All of them old-fashioned, but he was trained on them as part of his support training.

_"Transports 1 and 2, here's ORSL 1."_ said Jiminy, via radio _"Jiminy on it!"_

_"Jiminy!"_ said Cabby, obviously one of the pilots

"Dieu Merci, Jiminy Criquet!" said Cajun _"We thought you were dead or ran to Atlantis!"_

_"The main control room had gone to Oz. But I don't will need to walk the Yellow Brick Road. I lighted the lighthouse and I'm in the backup control room."_ said Jiminy

_"Alright!"_ said Soldaire, on the comms. _"Any tangos?"_

_"No... Although Blue Fairy said their twins are looking into the web for intel. Sounds like an Ultra Event."_ said Jiminy

_"Seem legit..."_ said Kilimanjaro _"This weather change is not natural and is not something I could achieve at all. I doubt even that Nagi guy would be able to do this, at least as fast."_

_"We had the refugees rescued, but we need to get there... And with this wind, as soon we touch the place, there'll be a chance a bout of wind throw us in the sea!"_ said Cabby

_"Let's us try the new magnetic locks Dumont built into the platform... I'll open the platform  and left it just a little down. You engage the maglocks as soon you touch down and I'll bring you back. You evacuate everyone to Atlantis. As soon both transports are down, I'll disengage and we get to Atlantis."_ said Jiminy

_"The best plan we can work by now!"_ said Dummont, while Jiminy saw the heli getting nearby by the radar and transponders.

_"Okay, you're into IDL, this is good news."_ said Jiminy

_"Any bad news?"_ said Cabby

_"Beside the weather, nothing."_ said Jiminy, working some buttons _"Engaging the first platform for you, Transport 2. Transport 1, do the orbit in the meantime. Don't try to stay still in the air: the bouts of wind will throw you in the sea like a ball of paper!"_

_"Alright."_ said Cajun, while Transport 2 touched the ground and the maglocks did his job, by holding the helicopter still while he was brought below the platform to the "garage", another platform closing over them

_"Now, be ready to get down, Transport 1. When touch and lock, full shutdown!"_ said Jiminy

_"Alright!"_ said Cajun in the helicopter.

_"Dumont, be nearby if the system fails. Maybe you can MacGyver something."_ said Jiminy

_"Right."_ he said.

It was when the Transport 1 touched and the maglock engaged, or at least on one of the skids.

But the other skid had not been fixed, and a bout of wind just made the helicopter fell aside in the platform while it was retracting, bringing back the helicopter, the main rotor blades being blasted of its mast, just the platform retraction saving the people in the helicopter of being hurt from the blades' debris.

_"Everyone okay?"_ said Jiminy, his heart almost going out

_"We are okay."_ said Kuntur. _"Beside the damages in the heli, and some small bruises, we're all okay, including the refugees."_

_"I'm getting there as soon we finish here."_ said LionHeart

_"I'm going too."_ said Jiminy, getting out the room

He ran to the Transport 1 "garage", while LionHeart and Djanni pushed the helicopter back on their skids.

_"Alright. Everyone,_ Pretty Please _follow our capes instructions to get orderly to a safe place!_ S'il vous plait suivez nos instructions de capes pour être ordonné dans un endroit sûr. aljamie, yrja min fadalakum aitibae 'iirshadat alraas ladayna lilhusul ealaa makan amin." said Jiminy, while they run and put everyone into the elevators to Atlantis.

Jiminy got with his group and Djanni with them.

_"Are you okay, Jiminy? You're almost naked."_ said Djanni

_"My clothes were all wet. I thought it would be better to just take them off before I got a... AAAAHHHH... AAAAAAHHHHHHH... A-TCCHOOOOOO!!!!"_ he said, and he sneezed

_"I warned you!"_ said into a singsong chirp Blue Fairy, still as the Morton Salt Girl, but his umbrella closed. 

_"And I said I would be glad to hear you say this...A-TCCHOOOOOO!!!!"_ said Jiminy, while they got down.

_"I think we all need some hot shower, dry clothes and good hot cocoa."_ said LionHeart, on another of the elevators, while they got down to Atlantis.

--- 

Things were not that good, though. After a hot shower and a new costume, Joshua felt himself very sore, his muscles sore for some reason and he could not speak too much, his throat sore and he was having some fever. Dr. Lesley Dimantas looked to him and asked for some exams. The Vernetech provided the results very fast:

_"Well... Well... Not too good news, Joshua."_ said Lesley, while Joshua got over an hospital bed in Atlantis' Medical Wing  _"Sounds like you had a very bad tonsillitis, combed with the cold. Sounds like your immunity was a little low recently and you got some bad viruses that made your tonsils grow inflamed."_

_"But... I'll be okay, right?"_ said Joshua, trying to speak the better he could with the sore throat.

_"We'll start with some antibiotics, adding it to the penicillin you already took, and look on how things will evolve, while the exams shows us what kind of things cause the tonsillitis. For now, I'll put you on a liquid diet: basically juices, soups and broths, no solid food to avoid pain and maybe some hurt that could make things goes worse. Maybe tomorrow or the day after you'll be able to deal with some purees and other mushy food..."_ said Lesley _"I'll avoid the tonsillectomy, the tonsils surgical extraction, as I don't know if there would be impacts on your immunological system, and as you're a breakthrough without healing powers and that deals constantly with refugees that, unknowingly by them of course, can be vectors from all kinds of infections and so, doing_ anything _that could compromise your immunological system would be a bad idea. Don't talk too much until your throat got okay."_

Joshua nodded.

_"I'll ask Richard to do a good strong soup, that reinforce your immunological system: I want to avoid put you on strong antibiotics. We already entered meds on you with the penicillin shot I gave you before. We'll enter with some oral antibiotics also, so we can use weaker antibiotics on injections and on the drip. As I don't know what kind of virus we have here, I'll ask everyone that came to talk with you to use masks and gloves: looks like a common viruses or bacteria... But I don't want to  take chances: Atlantis is an insulated environment, a cross contamination with a weird virus could be an incredible bad problem. I hope soon we have good news."_ said Lesley, while turning on the TV that was on some weird cartoon called _Masha and The Bear_ and getting out the room.

_"Wow! Sounds like really bad news."_ said Blue Fairy

_"I know you want to play the_ 'I warned you' _card."_ thought Joshua: the great advantage to talk with Blue Fairy is that he didn't need to really _talk_, as she was linked to his brain via the Quantum Link. He just needed to _think_ on what to talk. This made talking with her better now, as he doesn't feel pain.

_"Yes, I wanted, but... Tonsillitis is horrible! I remember when I had some of them: it was really painful. I just never complained because it was the same time that Hope, Astra, had cancer more or less that time."_ said Blue Fairy

_"She had cancer?"_ thought Joshua, abashed

_"Duh... Do you think that, because_ you _had undergone breakthrough as a kid, everyone else had? Hope wasn't_ always _Astra, you know. In fact, we could say that my_ original self, _Shelly Boyar, didn't saw her friend undergo breakthrough. We know about it because the_ Future Files _and because Shelly and Shell had searched for this information when they were activated into Astra's mind, more or less like I did with you. And this information was downloaded back on T.A.'s database, and so I could access it."_ said Blue Fairy

_"Wow..."_ said Joshua _"Never thought on this."_

_"I know."_ said Blue Fairy _"But let us see that cartoon in the TV. Looks fun how that girl looks like she's on a Red Bull overdose!"_ she said giggling.

Joshua was always felt weird on hearing Blue Fairy laughing into his head, but it was good on those situations where he was all alone. He always thought, and he knew Blue Fairy knew about it, that she was what allowed him to cope when he was kidnapped by _Alsyf Alayat_, the Sword Verses, a Caliphate nut with the same kind of powers of himself, although the _Sword Verse_, his _Do as I said!_ power, was really stronger than his _Pretty Please!_ as he even could put some _Post-Hypnotic Suggestion_ on others, like he did with Marjanah.

Some time after, Richard and a small man with a brunette hair and a Mexican face came with his dinner. For some reason, he was familiar for Joshua.

_"Hey,_ Pepito Grillo, _sounds like you got really sick."_ said the man, and it was when he recognized the voice.

_"Hufflepuff?"_ he tried to scream, but that resulted only on a rasp whisper and Joshua coughing in pain because of the tonsillitis, and Richard came and making Joshua drinks some water.

_"Don't talk by now."_ said Richard _"Medical orders. Lesley said me to bring you some reinforced food and I did a kind of soup. Some ideas from Andre, some from Juan and them we made a good something that could help you."_ said Richard, while Hufflepuff pushed the table for the bed where Joshua was, while Richard put a tray with a salver over it. Removing the top of it there was a steaming hot bowl of a good smelling soup.

_"I did it using some ideas from Andre, from some kind of Brazilian soup called_ canja, _by using rice, potato and Peruvian parsnip. And we put some powerful spice from Mexico and some_ chili con carne _on it, as Juan suggested."_ said Richard, while Juan lifted the bed head so he could eat the soup.

He took a spoonful of it and almost cough: he did a gesture indicating it was too hot.

_"Richard said you it took_ chili con carne. _And good_ chili con carne _is always very hot."_ said Juan, the brunette man, while Joshua took a gulp from a glass of water. _"That was what my_ abuela _gave me when I had any kind of cold: a good broth made with lots of_ chili con carne."

_"Okay... Just cool it out a little."_ said Richard, while Joshua did it.

The next spoonful, a little cooler, got down easily, without hurting more Joshua's throat. He smiled and gave a thumbs up, showing that it was really good.

_"Liked it? We are glad. We know that maybe your health had gone to the dogs thanks to how much rain and wind you took outside."_ said Richard, and Joshua gave a small shrug. 

_"Too much difficult to express yourself without talking?"_ said Juan _"Maybe Blue Fairy could help you."_

_"Hey! I'm not his translator."_ said Blue Fairy, although no one could hear her.

Joshua did a gesture showing his hand and then he pointed the TV.

_"Oh, yeah! You should need to touch the TV so you could download Blue Fairy."_ said Juan _"And, as you're all sore, maybe today this could be not a good idea."_ 

Joshua nodded, and then he pointed Juan's head and made a gesture like someone wearing a mask

_"Oh, my mask? You see... As a_ Luchador, _I avoid as much as possible show myself without the mask, so people doesn't associate_ me _me to_ Hufflepuff _me. In fact, I'm both, but as Hufflepuff I'm more than myself to everyone else. But I forgot my other masks were with my dirty clothes, and so I had no other mask after my own being so wet. I put it to dry a little into my room, but until it dries, I have no access to my powers as a_ Luchador, _as I'm without_ La Passion Por La Lucha. _If a_ enemigo _saw me this way, I could not affect him or even no one, but as things are more okay here, I chose to take it away and be just Juan Acierdo for some hours. Need to say that's a little weird for me, as I'm Hufflepuff almost 24/7/365."_

Joshua's eyes went wide and Juan understood the question: _"Aren't you afraid? You have no powers now!"_

_"Beside the refugees, no potential tangos could get here: remember we are at least 750 meters down the sea line, over the sea mantle. So few breakthroughs could get here without any kind of support. I think we are safe by now."_ said Juan

Joshua nodded while taking the food.

_"You were very courageous,_ Pepito Grillo." said Juan _"The tempest was really strong: if you didn't gave us the light, we could had lost ourself in the rain, and probably we would crash in the sea as soon the fuel ran out, and probably we would die. We couldn't see a nothing in front of us. And also you had gave us all directions and had the idea on to get into the platform and bring the helicopters in ASAP. I can't imagine how you walked on all this."_

Joshua gave a small nonchalantly look, like he was saying _"I was just doing my job."_

_"But now you're this sick."_ he said

_"Occupational Hazard."_ said Joshua by looking, while finishing his food. He finished the soup and they brought him a glass of chocolate milk as dessert.

_"Alright, let us go, or Lesley will come and kick us out your room. And she can do this as a Metamorph."_ said Richard, while they got out the room.

_"Never saw Hufflepuff without his mask... I say,_ for real: _all I know about this is based on information I gathered on your mind before show myself to you."_ said Blue Fairy.

_"He have no power without his mask, and, by what I read about his Power-Type, if the mask is destroyed or if he's shown on civil to big crowds, he can lost_ La Passion Por La Lucha, _and with it his powers, even forever. Because of this, for a_ Luchador _cape, a_ Lucha de Apuestas _is a big business, as the prize for the winner is the mask of the loser, that the winner could do whatever he wants to do, even destroy it, making impossible to recover_ La Passion Por La Lucha." thought Joshua.

_"Wow... Sounds like big business... So, the idea is that he could walk as civil without being noticed by others..."_ said Blue Fairy.

_"Yup..."_ thought Joshua _"And this is why he's almost all the time with his mask, even in shower: as we could be called to action fast, he could not be naïve enough to be unprepared, and for him, being unmasked is being unprepared."_ thought Joshua, when Dr. Lesley entering his room and she said, smiling.

_"Good news: looks like your tonsillitis is from a known bacteria. We'll stay with the antibiotics for some days and see. If the evolution in four days is not enough, I'll ready everything for the tonsillectomy. Looks like that tango doesn't want to let us get up for sometime: there was still the torment over us, but beside the control room there was no significant damages for ORSL 1. By now, we'll stay here at Atlantis, until we can go up. Sounds like some tangos are readying themselves to try to tag us and claim ORSL 1 for them,"_ said Dr. Lesley and she continued when he looked for Joshua face of anticipation _"but_ you'll NOT. GET. IN. ACTION. _You're on bench by medical orders. Rest and be good for get back. Don't play naïve with tonsillitis: any -itis disease is an infections, and ill-treated infections could result on a sepsis, and this would be_ REALLY. BAD. NEWS." she said, and Joshua gulped, which made a little pain in the throat.

_"So, I'll ask Wahiba to change your medication: she was ready as a campaign nurse. Maybe she could even get into Red Crescent if she doesn't want to stay with us after her sidekick."_ said Lesley _"Now, take some sleep. Tomorrow, I still want you to avoid talk. If you want to, you can 'download' Blue Fairy in the TV to help you... But now, sleep. Pip pip."_ she said, getting out the room while Wahiba got with his new medicament flask.

And, just a little after Wahiba got and exchange the medicament flask, Joshua dozed off.

## Chapter 13

> _"The tangos were persistent, but they suffered a lot: as soon the others got over back ORSL 1, they pushed them back hard. I didn't took action, because the tonsillitis wasn't healing that fast and I was very sore and had fever. But some time after, I was healed enough to get back the cape."_

> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

It was a good sunny day. Which was good, as Joshua was still recovering from the tonsillitis. After the Ultra Event, they had pushed back the tangos that tried to invade ORSL 1. However, they didn't discovered the Ultra that did all that mess. In the meantime, he needed to repair the damages ORSL 1 suffered.

Joshua was into a dark green combination of shirt and overalls, working on one replacement engine for the Transport 1, that lost his main blades and damaged both engines in the last rescue. 

_"How are you doing, Joshua?"_ said Kabba, who was working on it with him.

Joshua gave a thumbs up: as he was still recovering from the tonsillitis, he was avoiding to talk. he discovered that his _Pretty Please!_ is voice-dependant. So, with his voice still rasping and hoarse and his throat still sore, he was down on his _Pretty Please!_ as power. This way, it was better for him to help on other things, like repairing ORSL 1 damages.

_"Now... Let us see how things are."_ said Kabba, while Joshua finished to screw the engine close. He also put some oil on the places it was needed. _"Alright, back now, Joshua!"_ said Kabba, while they looked to the engine. Kabba just fixated it in a special test platform, connected some test equipment, and both put some ear protectors before Kabba gave the engine power on.

The Kerberos' howl the engine gave was familiar for Joshua, after all the time piloting helicopters, going to and from Siracusa and Malta, bringing supplies and sending refugees and so. Kabba looked satisfied also.

_"Sounds like our little baby here is okay. Let us wait just a little more, but as far I looked, the engine is correctly built."_ said Kabba.

Jiminy gave that look on _"Why not bring this thing assembled?"_

_"We need to be as self-dependant as possible, so the equipment maintenance should be our own. We'll only send equipment to others if they need some regimental inspections, like the helicopters. Otherwise, all the maintenance and inspections will be  on our own as much as possible."_ said Kabba, when they heard Wahiba into their minds.

_"Everyone, come to the conference room. Sounds like we have some intel on the tangos from the Ultra Event."_ she said.

_"Right, we are going."_ said Kabba, while shutting down the engine. _"We'll ask help for Altayr or Ric later to assemble this one in the helicopter. Let just remove the worst on the oil and dirt and get on. Seiji hates to be left waiting people."_

---

_"We discovered some intel about that tango from the tempest."_ said Soldaire, as soon everyone sat down in the ORSL 1 "war room", where he was showing the intel he received _"He also interfered on lots of operations on a region nearby Darfur where UN and LDS suspects is the main Caliphate site."_ he finished start to rolling out a presentation.

_"This is Yussuf Al-Hadq, and we still are gathering some intel on him. But what we know is that he was born at Romania as a Coptic Christian, but he had converted to Islamism and gone radical very fast. Some of the gossips and intel we are digging about him says he lost his family into a black ops from Romanian's government and that was what triggered his breakthrough. He gone totally psychologically broken, after suffering this black op and being discharged with dishonor."_ said Soldaire

_"And this is the kind of situation that people that want to enlist people against governments and other cultures likes..."_ said LionHeart _"Say a doctrine, religion or philosophy, and I can say you a, pardon the french, son of a bitch that wants to take this kind of people, broken and fragilized, to use as cannon fodder for their own causes. Saw that a lot in Bronx: Left, Right, Christian, Islam, Fascist, Socialist, you name it."_

_"You're right, Ric."_ said Soldaire _"He had converted to Islam and then radicalized: initially, he worked with Red Crescent and helped a lot, but it was when he had gone under a certain_ Imam _called Saladin Al-Hadith that worked as a Caliphate recruiter and indoctrinator, and then he had radicalized."_

_"And so he gone against other religions and so..."_ said Djanni disgusted _"Those_ murtadd _are the worst."_

_"Well... From the lose of his family to re-emerge as part of the more important_ Caliphate _guys it took 3 years. Beside being an Ultra weather manipulator, he's a incredible strategist and a incredible combatant: before the black ops, he served as a special operations officer for Romanian army, passing through all kind of bad times you can think in his life, from the falling of the Iron Curtain to the Event to China secession to the Caliphate War."_ said Soldaire.

_"Do you know anything about him, Blue Fairy?"_ thought Jiminy, while seeing Blue Fairy, dressed into a blue-colored Sherlock Holmes costume.

_"The game is afoot, Jiminy. I'm trying to get all intel I can, but the_ Future Files _are murky on this topic. I'm doing my best, and my twins are helping, but I'll need time."_ said Blue Fairy.

_"Right..."_ thought Jiminy.

_"Looks there's an Asimov that is double-crossing the Caliphate by leaking information about it. The data is still small and unprocessed, but looks like he had gathered lots of intel and is leaking it as soon is safe and checked on truthness..."_ said Soldaire _"How he's doing this undetected is a mystery. There's some talking about he being a TRON, an artificial entity created by a Verne that achieved consciousness on his own. He uses the capename_ Hudhud..."

_"The Hoopoe that shown Suleiman, Peace upon him, about the Queen of Saba, Bilquis, and his sun-worshipping apostasy. It was when Suleiman got to see about this."_ said Djanni, as a kind of trivia.

_"So... Looks like this Hoopoe wants to show us something rotten on Caliphate."_ said Kuntur

_"And what you have?"_ asked Panther

_"Lots of intel..."_ said Soldaire _"But Interpol and LDS are still working them to confirm or deny their validity. So, I'm still holding this on until we have things more confirmed."_

Soldaire took a sip of a glass of water, and then restarted.

_"Looks like the_ Caliphate _structure isn't_ that _centralized as everyone thought: they are more a_ concept _than an organization. They have cells all around the Mediterranean countries, and they are expanding to places as far as Indonesia, Vietnam and the Nordic countries."_ said Soldaire _"And they are not to fight a 'conventional' war: they noted that they would lose this way."_

_"So... They'll go for a kind of world guerrilla war?"_ said Sugarplum _"That's insane!"_

_"We agree, but sounds that, for them, this is a valid way to deal with their, quote-unquote,_ cleansing the world from the apostasies and heresies to the to-soon coming of the Mahdi. _In fact, the same old kind of balderdash since always. Crusades has done on this, fascism has done on this..."_ said Soldaire

_"We could lose hours lecturing each other on all this."_ said Marjanah, first time with her more "official" costume, as he had into a simple domino mask and overall suit into his revalidation, a common _hijab_ over her head. Now she was using a dark green tank top and pants with a veil-like _hijab_ covering her hair, a _niqab_ on the same color covering his face, leaving only her eyes out and a pair of Fake Orichalcum _Janbiya_ daggers on her wrist with her standard toolkit every _Herós Sans Frontières_ cape wear and should learn to use before taking the CAI-certification. He could see also her Crest: some lines that formed a kind of shape into Arabic style, like a fox or a fast wind, with Arabic text that he could recognized as Qu'ran's Sura 3, Verse 195. _"But this doesn't change the fact they use the Holy Qu'ran, with Allah the Most High (S.A.W)'s words, for hate. And this would not be."_

_"We need to be alert, also."_ said Soldaire _"We have some intel that says that the ORSL line, specially ORSL 1, are on their list of Alpha priority targets. This explains the intensity they pushed us last time. No matter what, we should not allow them to get into the platform."_

_"And this take us to the logistics: Transport 1 is crashed under repair. Transport 2 shouldn't be used for supplies. And the other two helis, 3 and 4, are small ones for patrol and small deliveries. Our supplies are dangerously low: we'll soon get into emergency levels."_ said Sugarplum.

_"We still have the boats if needed, but we'll need to work it smoothly: a sea like the one in tempest, and it would be doom for anyone on them."_ said Dumont.

_"Maybe we should haste the helis maintenance. How things are, Cabby, Jiminy."_ said Soldaire, but looking for Jiminy.

Cabby looked to Soldaire _"Jiminy is still recovering from the tonsillitis, but I can say that we are ahead on the schedule. We just finished to assemble the main engine and we are to build it back to the helicopter. We just need to finish then the tail reassembling and give some check before a test flight."_

_"Okay... Do it ASAP!"_ said Soldaire _"Reconstruct our defenses and repair our equipment is Alpha Priority."_

---

Joshua and Kabba worked hard on the Mi-171A2, Transport 1, and two days passed until everything was ready. The new Vernetech avionics were deployed and they had a new kind of avionics and weaponry for both Transport 1 and 2. The Transport 1 was being deployed at the platform, as they would do a Test flight.

_"Okay... Altayr, I want you to help us and be ready to take us if we need to jump out the helicopter."_ said Kabba.

_"Right."_ said Altayr.

_"And, Joshua, I want you to be the copilot."_ said Kabba, looking for Joshua, that was finishing to recover from the tonsillitis, so he gave a thumb up. _"If at anytime you see things is growing dangerous with your_ Bellax Analytica, _please alert me before it's too late. If you're still with problems with your voice, I think that Blue Fairy can help us."_

_"Alright."_ said Blue Fairy although no one could hear her beside Joshua

Joshua nodded and got for the copilot position and touch the contacts before, to "download" Blue Fairy into the system. Kabba sat into the pilot seat.

_"Nervous?"_ said Kabba.

_"A little."_ whispered Joshua, while fasting the seat-belts.

_"As soon I start the takeoff procedure, use your_ Bellax Analytica _as far you can."_ said Kabba, starting the takeoff procedure.

Things started as okay as ever, but when he was almost to give full power to takeoff, Jiminy felt something and passed the information through Blue Fairy into thinking speed.

_"Kabba! Stop now! Something is wrong with the Main Rotor Blades!"_ said Blue Fairy, and Kabba slowed it down a little and get out the heli.

_"Altayr, can you see anything?"_ said Kabba

Altayr concentrated a little, using his super-duper-vision and hearing, he saw something:

_"Looks like the main rotor dome is a little loose. The blades are vibrating. Just a little: I can just notice the vibration and the weird sounds of it because my super-senses."_ said Altayr.

_"This vibration would made the dome collapses, so the blade basically would fly off the dome and so we would have no power or sustentation for the helicopter. It would fall like a rock in the sea."_ said Blue Fairy.

_"Humm. Joshua, cut the power off and shut it down."_ said Kabba while running to the warehouse to catch some tools.

He came and asked Joshua for help while fixating correctly the main rotor. As soon they finish, they started again, asking Altayr to see if everything is alright.

_"It's stable!"_ said Altayr

_"It's right!"_ whispered Joshua _"My_ Bellax Analytica _shows no problem!"_

_"Alright, taking off."_ said Kabba, making the helicopter got up just some centimeters. _"Now, testing the tail rotors."_ 

He moved the lever to push it star side and port side.

_"Nothing, Joshua?"_ said Kabba

_"Nothing."_ he confirmed.

_"Nothing here too."_ said Altayr _"I'm using my super-senses and the tail is stable as rock!"_

_"Now, let us try a small flight, just to the IDL and back again."_ said Kabba, pushing the lever to the sea direction, Altayr starting to flight aside. 

It was a quick flight, and then they got back. Kabba did some check on structure and saw nothing that would displease him.

_"Okay... Everything sounds nice!"_ he said, satisfied. _"Think our Transport 1 is back."_

_"So we have some need on supplies."_ said Seiji, that gone next _"Go for your costumes while I'll send the list for Siracusa. We were operating on emergency levels. And I don't want to be catch off guard in a potential attack."_ 

_"Roger!"_ said Kabba and Joshua, running to put themselves ready.

## Chapter 14

> _"All the mess about that guy made some crazy guys got out of the radar. We are not like the people in comics that have that kind of super-power to be ubiquitous and know everything. We are limited, as are our resources..."_

> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

The Red Alert was alarmed everywhere. Jiminy just recovered himself from the tonsillitis and was doing some training on the boats when he heard Soldaire on his Earbug:

_"Jiminy, get back! We have a Code Red for the ORSL_ and _for all the CAI and SPAT teams in the Mediterranean!"_ said Soldaire

_"What?"_ said Jiminy, maneuvering the boat so fast that Cabby wasn't sent out in the sea just by sheer luck.

_"Hey Jiminy!"_ said Cabby _"Look out on when doing this."_

_"We are on a Code Red. Soldaire just asked me."_ said Jiminy, pushing the power lever to the max. _"Alright, we are a go, Soldaire!"_ said Jiminy in the Earbug.

As soon Jiminy and Cabby got there, they found Sugarplum, Djanni, Presto and Marjanah waiting them.

_"Okay, let's go!"_ said Jiminy

They got into the meeting room at ORSL 1, where the others were seeing some maps and TV news in the screens.

_"Alright... That's a weird situation: there was an Earthquake that almost turned the Hagia Sophia  at Constantinople into shambles, and also affected the Sultan Ahmed Mosque. Also did lots of damage at Constantinople State and some regions of Kurdistan, but didn't was detected some far away from that points. This is an physical impossibility, so for sure this is an_ Ultra Event. _Almost immediately the Caliphate had said it was not their work. Well, I don't think they would try to destroy a mosque. But there's something fishy on all this."_ said Soldaire

_"Could they be lying?"_ said Jiminy

_"I can't see..."_ said Djanni _"The Mosque is an important Sunni mosque, and many on the Caliphate are so."_ 

_"In fact... Even being a shi'a ones, like Alsyf Alayat, would always respect the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, as a holy ground."_ said Marjanah

_"So..."_ said Jiminy _"Even with a pinch of salt, should we take this as truth?"_

_"Sounds like."_ said LionHeart _"But... In this case, there's a third force acting all around... This sounds no good at all."_

_"Whatever... We'll have not too much time to speculate."_ said Soldaire _"We are into Code Red, Alpha Priority situation, defined by_ Herós Sans Frontières. _Sounds like many people lost their homes and are potentially getting away. Some of them even trying to get into Cyprus and Italy via Mediterranean. So, ORSL line is on a lockdown: no one getting in without previous granting. In ORSL 7 will be established a triage site, and they'll need all the cape support needed. However, we can't weaken the ORSL defense. We chose to send just some of you to help there. In fact: Sugarplum, Jiminy Cricket, Djanni, Marjanah, Presto, Squirrel Girl, you're the ones to be sent from our team. Sugarplum, you're the team leader for this, as beside Squirrel Girl, you're the only adult of the team. Your mission is to provide support at ORSL 7: they were just recently commissioned, and they still are a very small site."_

_"Right!"_ said Sugarplum

_"So, you'll take Transport 4, the Twin Squirrel, to get there. They would not have space for other helicopter, anyway. I think you'll need to stop at ORSL 3 and ORSL 5 before getting there."_ said Cabby _"Jiminy, you'll be the pilot. Presto can work as copilot, as he have some basic piloting training."_

_"Roger!"_ said Jiminy

_"Now, go for your rooms, take what you need and go."_ said Soldaire

_"And is what you_ really need." said Jiminy _"The Twin Squirrel has not too much space or cargo capacity."_

_"I can go by flying, if needed."_ said Djanni

_"No way."_ said Jiminy _"Too much tiring. Spare you strength for the action. I think we need all strength we need."_

_"Alright. Go go go!"_ said Sugarplum

Everyone got to their rooms: they knew the drill. They should take some costumes, maybe some civil clothes for off-duty time, all needed equipment, including the standard rescue belt all HSF capes uses and so.

Jiminy closed his bag and got to the Transport 4, their AS355-NP Ecureuil 2, and opened the cargo place and put his bag on it. Then he started to look the helicopter to check if everything's okay, while the others came to the helicopter garage.

_"Everyone, put your things on the luggage compartment."_ said Jiminy

_"Roger."_ the others said.

_"Jiminy, I've calculated a main route and some alternatives. Avoid to get too far from continent: just go more to the sea when approaching the legs. I've calculated the extra routes and marked all our friendly posts in the African Mediterranean seashore. Good news is that the weather will be good all time."_ said Cabby _"I'm transferring all the data for your_ epad, _and  Dumont installed some new vernetech HUD on Transport 4 recently."_

_"Okay. Pre-flight check okay, all green."_ said Jiminy, going for his position as pilot. _"Presto, in the copilot seat."_ 

_"Right!"_ said Presto, sitting on the Jiminy other side.

_"Everyone, get up!"_ said Jiminy _"Starting the departure procedure."_

Everyone got up, even being a little cramped, specially because Squirrel Girl's tail

_"Hey, we don't need this tail here!"_ said Djanni

_"Oh, pooh!"_ pouted Squirrel Girl, shrinking her tail

_"Now, everyone, there's some videogames the Chicago Sentinels gave us when I was revalidating my Certification. Play some Mario Kart to pass time, okay?"_ said Jiminy

_"Never thought I would be retorted by a kid."_ said Sugarplum, smiling, taking the small bag with the games

_"Alright... Let's start. Presto, double check me."_ said Jiminy, pushing the pilot headset

_"Right."_ said Presto, taking out his hat and putting the other headset

_"ORSL 1, Transport 4, readying for departure. Do the de-parking procedure while we do the departure checks."_ said Jiminy Cricket

_"Alright, Transport 4."_ said Cabby, that was the responsible for the system.

It was as smooth as it could be: in few minutes, the Transport 4 had departed for his 6-hour flight.

---

_"Are we nearly there yet daddy?"_ said Djanni, mocking a spoiled kid

_"No, Djanni!"_ said Jiminy, frustrated. He was taking a small rest, while Presto was piloting the helicopter. He was sore and tired and had not any time to have fun.

_"Calm down, Jiminy."_ said Sugarplum

_"Sorry... I'm really tired. Never pilot that much, even putting on account the stops for refuels and food and go to bathroom."_ said Jiminy

_"Alright... Think we are almost there, right?"_ said Marjanah

_"Sounds like: the map is showing we are getting nearby. And the fuel is below a third."_ said Jiminy

_"There it is, right?"_ said Presto, pointing a place in the sea with his empty hand.

There was another recommissioned oil platform. It was a bit smaller then ORSL 1, but the flag with the _Herós Sans Frontières_' banner on it could not be mistaken.

_"Alright... It's there!"_ said Jiminy, when he pushed the radio button _"ORSL 7, here is ORSL 1 Transport 4, calling for arriving procedure. Copy?"_

_"Copy. Go for frequency 455.840, encrypt level 1."_ said someone in the other side.

_"Roger."_ Jiminy said, setting the radio with the encryption mode and frequency determined.

_"Here's Jiminy Cricket, from ORSL 1. With me are Djanni, Atlas; Sugarplum and Presto, Merlins; Marjanah, Mentalist; Squirrel Girl, Metamorph. We are sent to reinforce ORSL 7 after the Hagia Sophia's Ultra Event, as asked for by ORSL 7 to ORSL 1."_

_"ORSL 7, here. Prop here. I'm the team leader. Thank you for the capes. We asked also for some medical supplies."_ said the ORSL 7 leader, and Jiminy recognized the voice: Prop was one of the guys who saved him in the first time he crossed with the _Pure God Work Fraternity_ people.

_"We had."_ said Squirrel Girl _"We brought some emergency supplies."_ 

_"And as soon we deploy the team, our heli will be able to transport some supplies from Cyprus and from ORSL 5 and 6. We are under an AS355-NP Ecureuil 2, so we don't have too much cargo by now. We chose to bring ourselves and some emergency supplies from your list. But the helicopter can be adapted to deal with cargo."_ said Jiminy, while approaching.

_"Roger. Go for the main heliport. We'll bring you inside via parking system."_ said Prop, while Jiminy was flying over the heliport. He touched down the Ecureuil 2 and some local Berets connected some hooks to hold the helicopter to the parking system. Jiminy started to shut down the engines while they were brought back. 

As soon they arrived at the helicopter park, he saw again Prop: big and, albeit American-born, cut as an English guy, he was a B-Class Atlas, weaker than Djanni, but very experienced. He also played rugby at college, and he had his breakthrough during a game that happened just in The Event. As he was a Prop in the game, he chose it as capename.

_"Nice to see you Jiminy."_ said Prop, shaking hands to everyone, while two Berets starts to unload and refuel the helicopter _"Soldaire said me you would get soon. I didn't believed when he said me you were the one piloting the heli, but need to say it's a nice surprise to see you able to do this."_

_"Nice to see you also, Prop."_ said Jiminy _"Those are the capes ORSL 1 could send by now: Djanni, Presto, Marjanah, Squirrel Girl and the team leader Sugarplum"_

_"Nice to see you."_ said Prop, shaking hands with everyone _"Now, I'll show you the quarters and then we'll talk our situation."_

The quarters were somewhat below the platform: ORSL 7 hasn't an Atlantis-like extension and so it grown in the sides of the lianas from the platform, all the extensions connected to the lianas. In one of those extensions was their rooms:

_"Two rooms for you: one for boys, other for girls."_ said Prop. _"Hope they are okay: we are not as big as ORSL 1, so things here are a little cramped."_

_"It's okay."_ said Sugarplum _"It'll be three for room, think we can go comfy enough."_

_"And think there'll not be too much time for sleep."_ said Prop _"We need you ASAP, as there lots of refugees, some of them casualties from the Ultra Event. And we are in need of supplies: ORSL 5 and 6 will be our proxies for supplies."_

_"Okay... Squirrel Girl, I want you to be with me to see about the refugees. Djanni, Presto, see for security improvements and work with internal security. Jiminy, Marjanah, as soon Transport 4 is refueled, go for ORSL 6 to bring supplies for us. Looks like we'll need as much of it as we can."_ said Sugarplum

_"Roger!"_ said everyone, joining their functions even without some rest

## Chapter 15

> _"From that time up, I lost track on how much I flown. It's weird to say this, because I'm a non-flyer breakthrough, but after four days I could almost start the Transport 4 without looking."_ 
>
> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

After some days, ORSL 7 situation was more stable, supplied on all it needs. Jiminy passed almost all the time between ORSL 7, the HSF base at Cyprus where some of the donations and supplies for ORSL 7 were, and ORSL 5. The Transport 4 was adapted quickly as a transportation helicopter, removing all the seats for passengers and leaving all it as cargo, as the AS355-NP was the _Twin Squirrel_ with the maximum of load 2,800 kg, and this allowed him to bring something over 1 ton of cargo. As he as the pilot and Presto or Djanni as copilot were slim, they could bring lots of supplies.

It was an exhaustive time for Jiminy, that flew there and back again a lot, at least two supplying missions every day. He took Presto as copilot so he could either relieve himself occasionally and offer some in-field training and flying hours for Presto.

_"This is a bore."_ said Presto frustrated, while taking the helicopter a little after they take off for another resupply mission, going to Cyprus _"Thought we would fight super-villains and so."_

_"This is not_ Sentinels _show. In fact, even the_ real _Sentinels doesn't fight super-villains on a frequent basis. Normally, we are shown as a symbol of power. And, in_ Herós Sans Frontières_, we are also symbols of_ hope: _remember that we are"_ said Jiminy, showing the _Herós Sans Frontières_ crest, with the motto of HSF "super-aide pour les super-besoins, _super-help for super-needs."_ 

_"Yeah... But..."_ 

_"But you thought that we would use our powers to fight super-villain over super-villain. It's normal: the films, shows and comic books show this as a cape life. However, a cape life is more about helping people as far you can than about kick butts."_ said Jiminy, while they are getting nearby the Cyprus HSF base.

---

They got down and took a meal while waiting for the heli being refueled and loaded with the supplies. 

_"How are things, Sargent Pearson?"_ said Jiminy

Sargent Allyson Pearson was the Cyprus HSF base commander. After some time at US Army, she chose to discharge herself from it and gone to HSF after too much wars and so. A _Caliphate War_ veteran, she came back to Cyprus as volunteer and took the commanding station after the former commander retired.

_"Tense, Jiminy..."_ said her _"After that Hagia Sofia mess, almost all military troops from everyone in the Mediterranean gone Code Yellow, ready to action. As Cyprus is an independent country, but with a love/hate relationship with some of their neighbors, like what was left of Turkey when Constantinople state rose and Kurdistan and Greece, people here is tense with the chance of an attack."_

_"Do you think Greece could try something?"_ said Presto

_"Better safe than sorry, kids. War is always part of international politics: we are not ready yet to deal with things without a big stick, even speaking softly between each other... We are all reflexes on the past politics: Monroe Doctrine, Cold War... All of this made us."_ said her, when they hear a BOOM! somewhere nearby.

_"What was that?"_ said Presto

_"It was an attack!"_ said Jiminy, using his _Bellax Analytica "Someone is trying to bring us the Foxtrot!"_

_"Caliphate?"_ said her

_"Doesn't look like."_ said Jiminy _"No identification, 100% breakthrough, the weakest C-Class!"_

_"What?"_ said Presto

_"Forget it!"_ said Sargent Pearson _"Leave this to us! As soon the heli is refueled, go away on emergency!"_

_"No chance!"_ said Jiminy _"Looks like they are looking for any weak spot! Let us at least help before the heli is ready!"_

_"Okay."_ said Sargent Pearson, when the sirens started to wail.

They could hear the BUDDHA-BUDDHA-BUDDHA from the military weapons, but they saw lots of guys coming.

_"Presto, be ready for defensive spells, as strong as you can!"_ said Jiminy _"Look out for Speedsters!"_ 

_"Roger!"_ confirmed Presto, concentrating himself

Jiminy felt his _Bellax Analytica_ engaging like a Danger Sense when a guy came to him, very fast. He had time to ready himself and, using Savate techniques and his Jiminy Cane, he dropped the guy as fast as he ran against him, a good kick and the taser on Jiminy Cane being enough to drop the guy.

He hear another guy screaming when some of Presto's _Magical Missiles_ were shot against him.

_"Dropped one, but they are strong! Shot other four, they didn't felt it."_ said Presto, doing some magical gestures _"Warding us!"_

_"Okay!"_ said Jiminy, setting the _Cricket_ pistols for _Stun_ _"We'll help the capes here!"_

_"Havoc protocols?"_ 

_"Not yet!"_ said Jiminy. _"Use the_ Magical Missiles: _they are weaker than other attacks, but provide us with the direct hit to stop Speedsters or Teleporters."_

_"Roger!"_ said Presto

They continued to fight and dropped two other guys, Jiminy's training on Savate paying the profits. They were making their best to resist until the heli to be refueled.

But they didn't counted with some old skeletons from them.

A rain of leaves were shot directly against both Jiminy and Presto. Both rolled out, but felt a vacuum sound which made them split. Jiminy also dodged a heated energy blast.

_"What?"_ thought Jiminy, feeling something wrong by the power combination

_"They! Here? What the ..."_ said Presto

They looked to their attackers: Kyle Montague, Razorleaf (real name: Jonathan Leaf) and Ballistic (real name: Sturm Williams)

But they looked stronger than they were before.

_"How they..."_ thought Jiminy.

_"Long time no see, shrimp."_ said Kyle _"Now... Less talk more action. Me, Razorleaf and Ballistic came for a tag, but never thought we would be so fortunate to find you two little goody two-shoes!"_

_"Kyle..."_

_"Shut the f$%k up, shrimp. I'm_ Fusion _now."_ said Kyle, or better, Fusion

_"Blue Fairy, anything?"_ thought Jiminy, trying to multitask his actions

_"Bad news. This kid is registered as a very powerful super-villain on the_ Future Files _and_ Ourobouros Files." said Blue Fairy

_"And about the others... They look stronger! A-Class at least!"_ 

_"In fact, they are. And this is weird, because the_ Files _doesn't show them so powerful...."_ 

_"Jiminy!"_ said Presto, using one of their Fireballs against Ballistic, that Teleported himself away from the attack. Razorleaf used his vines to attack Jiminy, that dodged again the attack. Fusion shot some plasma energy, but both Jiminy and Presto dodged. 

Problem is: they were split and would be ready to be flanked.

And the inexperienced Presto felt the worst: Razorleaf made an explosion of sharped leaves pass through Presto, even his reinforced cape uniform being not enough to stop him to being badly hurt!

_"PRESTO!"_ screamed Jiminy, his _Bellax Analytica_ confirming the real damage. Jiminy then put the _Crickets_ back his tails and prepared to use the _Tesla Arc Cannons_ on his hand. His first target was Razorleaf, but his _Bellax Analytica_ showed him that Ballistic was trying to get behind him. 

All he needed was his Jiminy Cane.

He unlocked the _Taser_ full discharge mode and hit Ballistic straight in the chest after rolling aside. The electrical discharge was so strong that even he being now a B-Class Ajax, he felt spasms and started to have a seizure.

_"Not enough to kill, but enough to take him out!"_ thought Jiminy, when he felt his Top Hat being hit by plasma, a smoke smell coming from the burnt tips of his hair.

_"Okay, shrimp!"_ said Fusion _"Now... It's you against us... Do you think you can_ Pretty Please! _us? Fat chance! I'll crisp you to bacon, fat sissy!"_

If it was Jiminy Cricket from _Metrocon_, Jiminy would be froze now again.

But not _this_ Jiminy Cricket.

Razorleaf attacked with leaves again, while Jiminy ran away from Presto. He rolled from the attack, when Fusion get nearby. He almost hit Jiminy with his plasma beam again, but Jiminy was now experienced on combat.

_"Need to say: I fight a A-Class Atlas and survived. I fight a_ Seif-Al-Din _wannabe and survived. It'll not a bunch of bullies that will drop me down!"_ said Jiminy

_"I'll broke Presto neck, if you try anything!"_ said Razorleaf, getting near Presto with his vines almost getting nearby his throat.

Jiminy reaction was to give two shots with the _Cannon_ and dropped Razorleaf, in pain. But this was enough to make Fusion hit him with some fire blast, enough to make his tails burns and his _Cannon_ connections haywire, shutting down as a safety protocol placed by Dumont.

_"Now... Let us see if you can go without those gizmos."_ said Fusion, while Jiminy thrown away his tails and, with them, his _Cricket_ pistols.

Fusion started shooting Jiminy with lots of small fireballs made of plasma, making him getting away, avoiding the attacks by just. Jiminy them got and run with the Jiminy Cane, sacking the swordcane from the cane hilt and hitting a clean hit, making a small trail of blood getting out Fusion. He tried to counter with a big plasma shot, but Jiminy rolled away, putting aside and giving another good hit against Fusion side.

_"I'm not the kid you punched almost to death, Kyle. I'll bring back Presto with me and you'll get back to SuperMax, where is your place."_

_"I'll never get back that place!"_ said Fusion

_"I would hope so: Cyprus has capital punishment for villains gone rogue."_ said Jiminy

_"All I need to do is kill."_ replied Fusion, shooting Jiminy again. And again Jiminy rolled away.

Jiminy ran to a place, while Fusion shot him again and again, but no shot hitting Jiminy. 

It was when Jiminy got what he wanted. His _Cricket_ pistol.

_"Do you think this can make something against me?"_ said Fusion, his voice exchanging into something from Hell while he was turning himself into a plasma body _"I'm_ SO. MUCH. MORE. THAN. YOU. _sissy. I always was, and always will be! I'll kill you, and kill that raghead kebab carpet kisser of friend, and that little Tinkerbell, and everyone that remember you. Your parents? Dead! Your friends? Dead! Your team? Dead!"_

_"You did the_ only _thing you should not do..."_ said Jiminy, changing the _Cricket_ pistol settings _"Menace my parents and friends."_

He started to shoot the plasma balls, while Jiminy run for his life.

But it was when he stopped. 

_"You're tired."_ said Jiminy _"Your power consumes you. Stay too much on this, and you'll burn like a candle. Stop now, and we'll be nice."_

_"The f$%k I'll."_ said Fusion, when he shot a bigger plasma shot.

Jiminy counted with this, his _Bellax Analytica_ showing the broken defense.

He gave a straight shot in Fusion's head.

It was enough: the thin laser blast passed through his head and he fell like a rotten fruit from the tree. Fusion gone back his human form. He ran to put the Blacklocks on him and Razorleaf, Ballistic frozen in the seizures induced by the taser. Then, as fast he could, he looked for Presto.

He was a bloody mess, and Jiminy gone really worried.

_"Dispatch, cape down on my position! Jiminy Cricket with a fallen cape, capename Presto! We need rescue ASAP. Massive loss of blood!"_ said Jiminy.

_"Alright, we're with a Speedster getting there!"_ said Dispatch _"Any tangos?"_

_"Three, all defeated. Two on Blacklocks, one with taser induced seizures, this one at least a  B-Class Ajax."_ said Jiminy, while taking the Vernetech first-aid kit part of his mandatory utility belt. _"Starting first aid: need some help."_

_"Roger: just a minute, we are hands full."_ said Dispatch, while Jiminy took away Presto's costume rags, and opening his shirt: he had lots of wounds into his chest and arms, and he started to close as fast and good as he could all the wounds over Presto's body. He cleaned and closed all the wounds he could, until someone got nearby.

_"Okay, Jiminy Cricket. Let this for us now and care for yourself. The tangos are getting away..."_ said the speedster, while a man aside, with a _Mediciéns Sans Frontières_ badge over his arm started to check for some vein to unction him. He took a small flask and put it some medication on a drip for Presto.

_"A Vernetech med from CADUCEUS we are testing: a synthetic blood replacement. Not good enough to replace a real transfusion, but enough to avoid him going into a shock that could send him into a real bad situation."_ said the medic _"And you?"_

_"Hurt, but I had worst before."_ said Jiminy. _"They gone stronger somehow: I fought those guys in the past and they weren't as powerful as they are now."_

_"Forget it by now. Our people is collecting the garbage. Care yourself."_

Jiminy looked his arm: he had some blisters starting to form over the burns Fusion provoked. He took a faucet and opened it to place some water, also passing over his head and so. Jiminy saw Presto being put into a stretcher when an Atlas came to take him with some harnesses.

_"How he are?"_ said Jiminy, trembling.

_"Not too good: he lost lots of blood. This is the bad news."_ said the medic, with made Jiminy trembling _"The good news is he's out of life danger, at least by now. He'll need some blood transfusion to get back to his best: he's unconscious, and maybe we'll induce coma so his body can have sometime to readjust itself. However, you done well to call us as fast you could. Now, we'll treat him: the guys will provide you some meds to treat yourself, and a place to take some sleep. Maybe tomorrow you'll get back ORSL 7."_

_"No... I'll stay here until Presto is okay."_ said Jiminy, while the Atlas took Presto to the local hospital for treatment.

_"Alright... But now, talk with people at ORSL 7 and take some sleep. There's nothing you can do by now."_ said the medic, while the Speedster took him and they zipped away.

## Chapter 16

> _"Seven days was what was needed to Presto heal the worst on his damages, being comatose during them. After that, he took some extra days for double check... I didn't wanted to get back, but there was nothing to do."_ 
>
> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

_"So..."_ said Jiminy, back on ORSL 7, talking with Sugarplum

_"I've on the interrogatory for those three at Cyprus."_ said Sugarplum _"They said they were here for some diversion... They were paid by a guy to bring some havoc to Cyprus' HSF base. If you remember that Cyprus is now part of a humanitarian corridor for Europe and part of our supply lines, trying to disrupt it would be interesting for some terrorist."_

_"Problem is:"_ talked Dr. Lesley _"Their profiles doesn't match their power: I asked for intel to HSF NYC HQ, and they send me those kids profiles from Detroit SuperMax: they had evicted it when The Ascendant done that Prison Break at the SuperMax. Their power level doesn't check with what we saw on your Maskcam and on the damages Presto suffered... They all were listed as B-Class, except that Ballistic kid, that was listed as C-Class Ajax with Jumping, in fact, teleporting capacities... But they were stronger: A-Class certainly."_

_"And we took some extra information with_ Chicago Sentinels, _and crossed with some of the intel Blue Fairy provided us."_ said Sugarplum _"The Ascendant maybe used his breakthrough power on them, as his power involves improve or demote, at least temporally, others' breakthrough powers. The Sentinels registered that when Astra lost temporally her Atlas powers after being kidnapped by the Ascendant."_

_"What kind of power is this?"_ asked Djanni _"Supernatural?"_

_"As far we know, not."_ said Sugarplum _"Sounds like a new, undocumented power set... Remember some Mentalism, but it's not like anything on_ Barlow's. _After this attack, the Sentinels and DSA chose to pass forward all intel they had on him that would not be treated as classified for all CAI teams around the world. Soldaire received himself a copy of the report, and he passed to us, to alert us on him. But I think there's nothing we can do by now, except wait for more turbocharged super-villain and do our best."_

_"And how is Presto?"_ said Jiminy

_"I'm okay now..."_ said Presto, entering the conference room. _"Albeit below my costume I'm looking like a mummy. But now I'm cleared to get back if needed."_

_"Great!"_ said Jiminy

_"Presto, I want you on the bench for a week."_ said Sugarplum _"You need to learn more on self-defense: relying only on your magic, no matter how powerful it is, is dangerous. I talked one of the capes here to give you some Jeet-Kune Do basic classes during this week."_

_"Can I join it?"_ said Jiminy _"Maybe this could help us. At least, Presto would not be alone on training. I know how much this is a bore from my time with Cajun."_

_"As far you stay on his duty of resupplying... Although they chose to cut the Cyprus line while everything goes tidy. ORSL 5 and 6 are now sending us the supplies. I think this will do: I'll talk with Colocation."_

---

Some hours after, both Jiminy and Presto were at the improvised Dojo on ORSL 7 academy. The _tatami_ were the same used on other martial arts practices, but in a corner there was a photo of Bruce Lee. Either them and Colocation, a slim and otherwise common Chinese-looking cape, were on civil, beside the training clothes: Presto on some comfortable clothes from Hillwood P.E helping holding his bandages. and Jiminy on his _aide-moniteur integrale_, the clothes of a  Savate auxiliary instructor. She, otherwise, was into a Kung Fu like clothes, with a red and white belt that she tied at the front, on traditional style. She bowed to them, that replied accordingly.

"'Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.' _This is one of the most famous quotes of the Jeet Kune Do creator Bruce Lee."_ said Colocation, or better _"You may know him from old martial arts flicks, but in fact he was more than an actor or a fighter: he was a philosopher, majored on it at University of Washington, studying all he could about how to fight and, above all, how_ not _to fight. This is one of the his quotes I love the most: I could say it saved my life. Understand what he wanted to say with_ 'Be water, my friend' _showed me, even before my breakthrough, a way to fight."_

_"I'm Susan Ma, capename Colocation."_ said Colocation, or better, Susan Ma _"Here you'll not be the capes Jiminy Cricket and Presto, but Joshua McCarthy and Carlyle Galatas, and above all, I'll be your_ Sifu, _your mistress. Did you understand?"_

_"Yes,_ Sifu." said both

_"Nice... You both has some discipline: this is good. From tomorrow on, I want you to be on some Jeet Kune Do uniforms: I asked Sugarplum to provide it for you and they are coming with today's supplies. I want you to be always clean and presentable: Jeet-Kune Do is about flexibility, but is also about respect and discipline. I know you both has some fighting skills, but you'll start from the very beginning. Don't think that you'll become masters so soon: I took good five years to become a licensed_ Sifu, _and even that I learned lots of new techniques._ Sifu _Lee praised flexibility and adaptation: it's said he even incorporated ballet moves on his martial arts skill. Because, he says, the other martial arts systems gone rigid on attack/defense formulae."_

_"What do you think made_ Sifu _Lee think on this?"_ said Susan

_"Because, Sifu,"_ said Joshua, after thinking a little _"a real fight is not conventioned?"_

_"Right."_ said Susan _"For teaching, the attack/defense formulae_, kata, _are important, by teaching the student why each move is done and what kind of move would blow or intercept the opponent move. The_ Wax On, Wax Off _thing. It works for someone without any previous combat experience, like, I would say, 70% of people. But in real life, the first thing someone will do is to get away from the formula: if you know that I'll block your punch to my belly with my arm, why should you punch me to my belly? Why not to feint and give an elbow blow, or maybe a hand chop, or even give a step and kick, or... You know, hit me where my defenses are open. But, at the same time, I could ready a kick to give against you and so..."_

_"And_ here _came the_ 'Be Water, My Friend': _eastern cultures, specially Chinese and Japanese, focus in Five Elements, instead of the Four from West. Three are common: Fire, Air, Water. Earth, we could say, are split into two others: Metal and Wood. But why Water was so important?"_ asked Susan

_"Because, Sifu,"_ said Carlyle _"it can be flexible and destructible: anyone that saw a Typhoon or even a flood could see how much some damage tons of water could do. But, at the same time, water can go through any small slit."_

_"Correct, Galatas."_ said Susan "'Water, as life, finds a way', _my Sifu always said. This was the first thing he said for me, and the last one: I was training with my Sifu before I would help him on teaching others, when the Event happened. In the Chaos of the Event, we thought on go for help people, when a bunch of neo-nazi came to try to destroy our_ Dojo. _We thought we could deal with them peacefully, but one of them just came and stabbed my Sifu with a big hunter knife. I became water, a tsunami. It was then, in the stress of the Event, I've gone breakthrough. I jumped to this guy, teleporting to the front of him into a blink of an eye, and punched it. I certainly broke even more than his sternum: I collapsed his solar plex chakra, his heart exploding into his chest like a bloody balloon. The others tried to run, but I jumped again and gone to them, messing with their chakras to make them goes unconscious while the police came... But this didn't saved my Sifu: even using my Dragon powers, trying to stabilize either the damage he suffered and his_ Chi _flow, he lost lots of blood and died."_

_"But as he said_, "Water, as life, finds  a way". _I was his heiress on the_ Dojo, _and Prop and the others came to form the Guardians for our city, in the same model of Sentinels. With time, the team grew and recently it grew enough we could go overseas, as we were all_ Herós Sans Frontières _reserves. When ORSL 7 was commissioning, they asked for capes, and here we are."_ she said

_"Well... Enough chit-chat: let us start with some calisthenics."_ she said starting the strenuous training session.

And there it was: they started to train the basic punches, kicks and so. And they trained lots of defenses.

"Jeet-Kune Do _means_ Way of the Intercepting Fist. _Focus on it: your fist needs to intercept the attack. Your eyes needs to intercept the attack. You need to intercept the attack. No get ready, no postures. Like water. Water gave no warning when explodes. Water came from the skies suddenly, break the waves in the shore without alert. This is water as destruction. But water also goes into all the little cracks, even crossing the microscopic space into earth, to grow into a water veil. This is water as life."_ said Susan, while they trained their own punches and kicks and all the techniques.

In three days, both Joshua and Carlyle were trained in the basics, trying to develop the stop hits and straight punches. Both were tired and somewhat frustrated, but it was when Susan came to them.

_"Three intense days and you had understand the basics."_ she said _"You are into a good way. Specially you, Carlyle: you had no contact before on martial arts, just the self defense. I'm not here to teach you all the Jeet-Kune: after all, Jeet-Kune is hybrid and based on the idea of each one has his own capabilities, and so should be martial arts. The basics are the basics, as a punch is a punch and a kick is a kick. However, after you learn the basics and mastered it, you'll need to start to develop yourself in other ways."_

Joshua and Carlyle continued by the other three days, and it was when Susan said that the last day would be a exam to see how good they learned.

_"Normally it would took three months, but you were dedicating yourself on this so much I think we need to see how much you improved. Let us see how you learned the basics."_ said her next day, both of them showing her what they learned.

It was impressive: albeit a kata exhibition was normally a no-no in Jeet-Kune Do, they did it as a way to show how much they learned. And it was impressive: fast, precise and simple. Susan looked satisfied.

_"There's lots of improvement to be done. You're green and beginner. But you did well in only one week: you learned the basics and improved it for your own styles. Carlyle looks like someone stronger, but Joshua is faster. No one of you are better, but no one of you are worse than the other. This is Jeet-Kune Do, to adapt the basics for their own in the same framework: your techniques are similar because they follow the same framework, but they are unique because you adapted it for your own."_ said Susan, offering them the new yellow-white belts, that they changed in front of her and the others from their team.

However, the red alert sirens shown then the time they would be needed came

_"Code Red! Code Red! We have a situation, an aftershock at Hagia Sofia! Code Red!"_ said the system.

_"Presto, Jiminy, put yourself under costume. Jiminy, be ready to transport us to Hagia Sofia. In the meantime, everyone goes for your basic kits. Djanni, take Jiminy and Presto's. I'll help."_ said Sugarplum

_"We'll see the previous information. Take a shower, go into costumes and we'll provide you intel as soon we could. Your rendezvous will be at HSF HQ at Constantinople!"_ said Colocation

_"Roger!"_ said everyone, while Jiminy and Carlyle gone for shower.

## Chapter 17

> _"The Hagia Sophia aftershock was something we didn't expected: it was stronger than the original event. Presto was still finishing to heal his wounds against Fusion and his gang. But we needed to go after all. So, in fifteen minutes, we were at the ORSL 1 Transport 4, going to Constantinople."_ 
>
> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

ORSL 1's Transport 4 just arrived at HSF base at Constantinople, an old Turkey military airport decommissioned and recommissioned as base by HSF. Squirrel Girl stayed at ORSL 7 as support: they knew the worst cases would be delocated to ORSL 7, either via helicopter and via Atlas capes. In their place came Colocation and Split/Second: one of the weakest spots on Jiminy team was not have someone able to deal with Speedsters, something just compensated by Presto's _Magic Missiles_ that hit his target by sure, even slightly, but enough to slow down Speedsters for the rest of the team.

_"Alright, let us see the situation."_ said Sugarplum _"We'll take some transport and establish a forward post at the city. This will be like Newark some months before."_ she said, when the local commander came.

_"Commander Bahadir, HSF, ma'am"_ said the man on military fatigues, an old-fashioned one that still had on it an old Turkish flag. _"The earthquake was again at Hagia Sophia, but this one were more powerful, 8.0 on the main site. The temple had not collapsed just by Allah's (S.A.W) will, but there's lots of damage and casualties. Still have people on the debris, our teleporters working hard to detect them."_

_"Alright... We'll help: we need two SUVs for transport our teams. We'll try to find some place we can use as an outpost for first aid and triage. The worst cases we'll send to ORSL 7 for help: we have a surgery team and capes ready for the job."_ said Sugarplum

_"All the local mosques are open for us: we'll just put a Red Crescent flag in the SUVs."_ said Bahadir.

_"Right!"_ said Sugarplum, while came two white SUVs, ready for them with the Red Crescent on it. They split the team into both and loaded them with their kits and some extra supplies Djanni flew from the heli.

_"Jiminy, Presto: establish our outpost where you find it's good. You know the drill: do the comms first, ASAP with ORSL line. The others, for the rescue. Marjanah, looks for people under the debris with your Astral form. Djanni and Split/Second, help on cleaning the debris. I'll be on first care and contact with NGOs."_ said Sugarplum, while Split/Second stopped the car in front of a local restaurant that looked a little better, without cracks and too much debris. They entered and the owner was cleaning things a little.

_"Sir, we are capes from_ Herós Sans Frontières." said Djanni, talking Turkish _"I'm Djanni, and those are my fellows. We need a place to establish an outpost to attend the survivors and the needed. Could you help us lending your restaurant? As soon everything goes okay, we'll take everything and leave."_

_"Right, right... I see you're from Red Crescent, so at least some of you are with Allah (S.A.W). It's okay for me: anything you need, just ask."_ said the man

_"Alright. Mister, those are Jiminy Cricket and Presto. They'll start to deploy things, while the rest of us will go look for survivors. Could you help them? Me and the others are going to rescue people under the debris."_ said Djanni

_"They speak Turkish?"_ said the man, and Djanni made the question in Arabic for the others.

_"No... But I speak some Arabic."_ said Jiminy _"I'm Jiminy Cricket, sir."_ he said, doing the _salaam_

_"Looks like you're infidel, but a very well educated one."_ said the man, smiling, replying the _salaam_ _"I'm Kaan Erbakan. You can do what you need."_

_"Alright:"_ said Sugarplum, on English _"Jiminy, Presto, Alpha Priority on comms."_

_"Roger!"_ they said, while the others got back to the SUVs

_"That woman is your leader?"_ said Kaan

_"Yes, mister. She's capename Sugarplum"_ said Jiminy, as Presto didn't speak either Arabic and Turkish _"She's very competent."_

_"Looks so, if all of you trust her."_ he says _"Alright, what you need me first?"_

---

With the help of Mr. Kaan, they built the communication station, using the Vernetech transmitters and antennae. They contacted local Police and Dispatch and acted with them. They also built a small base on Mr. Kaan restaurant, that was helping people providing some Doner Kebap, slices of lamb into bread.

Djanni started to bring people to the outpost, where Presto and Jiminy could help with triage. Some of them were okay, just scared and dirty: a moist water towel to clean themselves and a samovar of tea helped them to be on their own again, and then they could go for some of the emergency accommodations at local schools and mosques.

Others, however, needed to be treated: the best ones, with scratches and bruises and other small damages, were dealt by Jiminy and Presto, as both of them, as part of basic CAI-training, where also EMT trained. Jiminy even could do some stitches on those who had small damages, using the Skin Stapler part of the CAI kit. 

There was, however, those who needed special care, and for this a team of Red Crescent and _Mediciéns Sans Frontières_ doctors used a room as a special surgery room, at least to establish those who were on real serious conditions.

One of them, however, needed to be transported for some place for a more serious surgery, and the local hospital were totally cramped.

_"Jiminy, Presto, Split/Second and Colocation, you will transport him as soon the doctors prepares him for transportation. You need to go for ORSL 7: a medical team is already prepared to do the surgery as soon as you got there with him, as they have all the information on the patient situation. Colocation will go with you, as she has special EMT training."_ said Sugarplum _"The Transport 4 is already prepared: you'll take this guy with you. Go and come back as soon you came: you'll be refueled there as soon you touch and loaded with some emergency medical supplies. Get back as soon you are refueled and loaded. Be cautious with potential new breakthroughs. I can't free Djanni, we need him here because his Atlas strength. And if it wasn't a serious case, I would not left Colocation too: her teleport power is crucial."_

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy and Presto, getting into the SUV they came, that was soon adapted into a makeshift ambulance. 

_"This is a mess."_ said Presto _"Where's all the doctors?"_

_"Hands full, as almost everyone else."_ said Jiminy _"It's commonplace on this job."_

_"Understood."_ they said, while they helped the doctors to put the stretcher into the SUV.

_"Right."_ said Colocation _"Split/Second, you're in the wheel. Jiminy, want you into the passenger seat_, Bellax Analytica _all the time. Me and Presto will be beside the doctors, to protect and help them till we get at the base. There, Split/Second and the doctors will get back and it'll be with us."_

_"Roger!"_ Jiminy said, seating and fastening the seat-belt, readying himself by engaging _Bellax Analytica_ to see the route they were going and just that.

_"How many time you can foresee?"_ said Colocation

_"After all the training I did, I think 10, 15 seconds, focused totally on this."_ said Jiminy

_"That will do... Any weird things, say in the Earbug. Split/Second is trained to drive using his Speedster power engaged, so he can use this to avoid some problems. We need a smooth travel, right?"_ asked Colocation

_"Right."_ said Jiminy

_"So,let'sgo."_ said Split/Second, already into Speedster mode.

The first two minutes were okay, until Jiminy said

_"Wait! There'll be someone crossing there, maybe a new breakthrough."_ said Jiminy

_"Bad one?"_ said Colocation

_"Can't say, unless we stay into our way. If we detour, we can go safe, but never know."_ said Jiminy

_"Detouringbettersafethansorry."_ said Split/Second, turning the car.

_"This is common? People under breakthrough in places like here?"_ said Presto

_"Yup. Breakthrough is a survival instinct. Being triggered on places and situations like this one is very common."_ said Jiminy, when they got near the base. 

And Jiminy screamed:

_"LOOK OUT!"_

And some guys came to attack the SUV.

_"Jiminy, Split/Second, go! Presto, with me!"_ said Colocation, touching Presto.

_"Roger!"_ said Presto, while Colocation teleported them out of the SUV.

_"Full on pedal, Split/Second!"_ said Jiminy

_"Roger!"_ he said

They got into the base and ran fast until they got to the heliport where ORSL 1 Transport 4 were.

_"How are things, Colocation?"_ said Jiminy on the Earbug.

_"Easy peasy. Small fish. Go for the heli and ready everything ASAP! We'll join you as soon we deal with this rabble."_ said her

_"Roger!"_ said Jiminy, running for the helicopter _"Split/Second, help the doctors to put this guy in the heli while I do the check and start everything!"_

_"Okay!"_ said Split/Second

Jiminy sat into the pilot position, and touched the XLR contacts 

_"Blue Fairy, be ready. I'll download you into the electronics. If we need, I want you to work the HUD and turret!"_ said Jiminy

_"Okay!"_ said Blue Fairy, with a shirt with a logo of Hagia Sophia, like she was a tourist, going to the system.

Jiminy gave all the checks while Split/Second and the doctors transfered the guy, with lots of damages and a leg into a weird angle, that was sedated into a coma.

_"Jiminy, you'll need to go fast and smooth."_ said Split/Second, out of his speedster mode.

_"Right!"_ yelled Jiminy, as he almost couldn't hear Split/Second, with the helicopter engine engaged. Colocation came with Presto, that had a sore eye.

_"Are you okay?"_ said Jiminy

_"Okay."_ said Presto, getting into the copilot place, while Colocation sat in the medic post. _"They had the worse, believe me."_

_"Presto was really good in combat: he used his magical shields like_ Doctor Strange _or something like that!"_ said Colocation, while the doctors finished to connect the helicopter's monitoring devices and oxygen tubes on the guy and closed the door, getting away from the helicopter back to the SUV with Split/Second.

_"Alright: takeoff!"_ said Jiminy, pushing the power lever to get away. _"HSF base, Constantinople: ORSL 1 Transport 4 on emergency takeoff. Jiminy Cricket on the lever. Destination ORSL 7"_

_"Roger!"_ said the tower. _"We are calculating a route..."_

_"No need for: we have our means. Just stay with us until we got into ORSL."_ said Jiminy

_"Roger!"_ said the tower

_"Blue Fairy, route to ORSL 7, as straight you can."_ said Jiminy

_"Roger!"_ said Blue Fairy.

And then, they flow as fast they could.

They took the fastest route Blue Fairy calculated, and Jiminy pushed the speed as fast as he could, but avoiding bumps in the helicopter to avoid extra wounds on the man they were transporting.

And it was when Jiminy felt his _Bellax Analytica_ acting as a Danger sense

_"Presto, shields all around the heli, NOW! As big as you can"_ 

_"Roger!"_ said Presto

It was just a split second after Presto ready the shield, they felt a small bump from the air delocation made by a rocket exploding middle air.

_"Sky pirates!"_ said Blue Fairy _"And lots of them!"_

_"Any badges?"_ asked Jiminy

_"No... But looks Caliphate!"_ said Blue Fairy

_"Use the turret to shot them to the water: their ornithopters have parachutes. Don't engage even more them. Presto, be our defense: your discretion in magics. Colocation, be ready for shoot as I've said for Blue Fairy. I'll push over the heli!"_ said Jiminy, forcing the power lever extra speed.

_"Right!"_ said Presto, opening the copilot door and using his hands to invoke some Magic Missiles.

For Presto, Magic Missiles are a staple for some reasons.

First, even being weaker, he didn't need to focus on the target: they were a pursuing weapon. Even A-Class Speedsters or Teleporters could be hit by them as soon they were locked on the target.

Second, they are a extremely viable way to neutralize tangos without killing. Like he was doing now.

The Missiles targets were not the tangos, but _their ornithopters_: by shooting them, he made them fall, making them use their parachutes to save themselves.

He cleaned part of the worst rabble, the common criminals and some of the weak breakthrough. But still there was two or three of them, one of them strong enough to hold an RPG launcher with them while flying.

_"I can't use my Missiles again! Exhausted my supply!"_ said Presto, tired

_"Leave this to me."_ said Colocation, putting a parachute _"Jiminy, Presto, no matter what happen, stick to the plan."_

_"What will you do?"_ said Jiminy

_"Just see..."_ said Colocation, taking a pair of brass-made Vernetech _tonfa_ from her belt and Teleporting.

_"What the..."_ said Presto, when he looked _"She's using Jeet-Kune against them_ in the air!"

Colocation was a Teleporter, but was also a Dragon, which allowed her to fight them. But they never believed she could use martial arts in the air. But now they could understand better _Sifu_ Ma, and how much they underrated her.

_"What kind of water she is now?"_ asked Presto, looking her kicking a guy and teleporting just a second before fall with the guy she kicked to the sea.

_"A waterfall."_ said Jiminy, smiling, when he looked to Blue Fairy, that was shown in the HUD _"Blue Fairy, what you have about this man we are transporting?"_ 

_"I'll check the_ Files." said Blue Fairy, going into a POOF.

Fast, Colocation got back to the heli with a little BUMP.

_"Okay, the rabble is out."_ said Colocation, fastening herself back. _"I don't know who is this guy, but looks like those guys wanted him dearly dead or alive... Likely dead..."_

_"Had put Blue Fairy to see for him. She has access to certain files that provide us intel from time to time."_ said Jiminy

_"Blue Fairy?"_ said Colocation

_"Long Story... Let things cool down and I'll explain."_ said Jiminy, when Blue Fairy got back, dressed as a cheesy Sherlock Holmes gender-swap cosplayer.

_"Jiminy... I have good and bad news..."_ she said, pushing the pipe to her mouth

---

Jiminy finished the arrival procedure at ORSL 7, and a team of doctors and capes came to them.

_"Alright, the surgery room is ready."_ said one of the Doctors _"We take from here."_ 

The capes and HSF operatives started to refuel the heli and put the needed medical supplies crates and boxes.

_"Wow..."_ said Squirrel Girl _"So this was one of the Caliphate big kahunas and he defected them some time before the earthquake?"_

_"Yeah!"_ said Blue Fairy, again "downloaded" into a holographic device occasionally Jiminy Cricket uses to make her visible for others _"Samet Mardin, 24, one of the main non-breakthrough guys in the Caliphate. He has a major on Engineering at University of Constantinople, and also had some formation on the_ Hanafi madhhab, _a common school of jurisprudence under Islam at the old Turkey, now Constantinople. He wasn't a warrior, at least no more than anyone on mandatory military service, but he was a good orator. Ourobouros and T.A files list him as a target, but not for neutralization: looks like he's too much moderate to be someone ready to explode himself. However, he knowledge on Engineering make him someone that potentially develop plans for destroying buildings?"_

_"Is he a POI?"_ said Colocation

_"Yes... But he was low-profile, so no intervention from CIA or others."_ said Blue Fairy

_"And where he was doing?"_ said Presto

_"Well... He was at home after some time with the Caliphate: he have woman and two kids there, none of them linked to the Caliphate. Looks like he decided to defect the Caliphate during this time."_ said Blue Fairy

_"Well... For now, Mr. Mardin is a patient and we'll heal him."_ said Squirrel Girl _"Send this intel about this guy for Sugarplum. Find his family and, as soon things calm down, bring them here. This could ease any information we could extract from him."_ 

_"Roger!"_ said Jiminy, while they saw all the supplies loaded at the helicopter

_"Okay. Go back and explain what is happening now."_ said Squirrel Girl _"Soldaire will be called also. If you can, see if Marjanah know him from the time she was under the_ Sword Verse" she said, referring to the post-hypnotic trance one of the worst villains they crossed with, _Alsyf Alayat_, was able to put people under.

_"Okay."_ said Presto, while Jiminy fired the helicopter engines back.

## Chapter 19

> _"The Hagia Sophia situation was a big mess: an **Us vs Them** combat is already a messy, bloody thing, but when you split things in a multi-front situation, things grows even worse. And that was a times that even Sun Tzu would be worried."_ 
>
> _**Seiji Shirou**, "The Art of War and the post-Event situation strategy"_

_"So... The thing grew really worse on the Caliphate?"_ said Seiji, via video-conference, with Jiminy

_"Yeah... I was in the interrogatory, and Mr. Mardin confirmed us that the Caliphate is fracturing itself into factions. At least three big groups are now developed: one, that Mr. Mardin was/is part of, is working to get back to legality and try to dispute their agenda as part of democratic forces and are about to become a political party, and were holding conversations with local governments for this. The second is what we know as_ the _Caliphate, that still wants to make Shar'ia a legal system and to expel or kill non-Muslins and enemies. They are also against work with_ zindiq _or_ murtadd, _in fact with foreigners. And them came a third faction is one that are not against work with foreigner and non-Muslins as far this help them to advance their agenda, even hating them."_ said Jiminy

_"And this group somehow got under The Ascendant's radar?"_ said Seiji

_"Looks like: sounds like The Ascendant offered support for The Caliphate, by triggering some breakthrough and raising the power of the breakthroughs they already had. With this, the third faction is growing into power and co-opted the second one against the moderates, pushing a pogrom against them."_ said Jiminy

_"And then..."_ said Seiji

_"There's lots of guerrilla fights at the Balkans, specially in places like Kosovo, where the Muslin communities are bigger."_ said Jiminy. _"The Caliphate fracturing is a big problem, right?"_

_"For sure: fighting a big strong group is a problem... But fight_ three groups _as strong the first one is a bigger mess: the big kahunas on UN and LDS are freaking out. The Ascendant is almost to turn into the big menace since Acar, the Caliphate founder. And the biggest problem is that he always works via proxies: in Chicago, he got some super-villains and super-duds like some of The Crew, and now he's working via The Caliphate."_ said Seiji _"Fighting via proxy is a dirty, but effective, way to fight, as Cold War proved: neither USSR and US suffered the pain Korea, Vietnam, Latin America, Afghanistan suffered. The political profits on this were all cashed by the big countries, and the costs were all externalized for the developing nations, the so-called Third Nations. The Ascendant is a result of The Event **AND** of the lessons we didn't learned on the Cold War."_

_"And about us?"_ said Jiminy

_"By now, nothing changes: we'll be ready at ORSL 1. You and the others will stay at ORSL 7 until Code Blue is back. Stay on your job: everyone is doing well, by what I'm reading on the After-Action Reports. I'll also talk with Sugarplum for extra intel for the team leader. By now, stay on job and we'll deal with The Ascendant later. Over."_ said Seiji, closing the video-conference connection at ORSL 7.

_"Well... Let's go back Constantinople."_ said Jiminy for himself, while he got back to the Twin Squirrel, where Presto was already waiting him.

_"How it was with Soldaire?"_ said Presto.

_"He is worried."_ said Jiminy, while looking Presto turning on the helicopter _"Super-villains are always a problem, but_ The Ascendant _is a big problem, the biggest since The Event now that Teatime Anarchist and Seif-Al-Din are deceased: you saw Fusion, Razorleaf and Ballistic. They gone stronger than they were before, and that was obviously an artificial grow. Think now that you could turn people superpowered at whim. This is the biggest problem on The Ascendant: he can give or take powers on anyone. There is very few limitations on his powers: looks like he need to have a non-hostile target, as he needed to knockout Astra before blocking her powers."_ 

_"And how could we take him down?"_

_"By now, there's nothing we can do."_ said Jiminy, shrugging, while Presto took of the helicopter _"The only thing is that The Ascendant can't change powers and also can't apply his power against himself. So, he could not turn himself into an Ajax, Atlas or something like this out of nothing. This means he's a 'common' human for damage"_ 

_"So, he could be killed by a  common bullet?"_ said Presto, looking a little disappointed

_"As easy as any of us."_ said Jiminy _"In fact, beside Ajaxes or Atlases, few other breakthroughs is really_ super, _if you take the old comics as reference. We just has our ways to avoid or cope damage: I can precog bullets or attacks. You and Sugarplum can use magical shield and healing. Dumont has armor under his formals and so on."_

_"Alright.. But if we could find him, we could just put a bullet on his head and it would be over?"_ said Presto

_"Yes... But I don't think that would be that easy to take him down: I believe he would had some security principles. But, anyway, he's not our problem."_ said Jiminy

_"Why not? He could create other Ultra tangos like the guy who did this to Hagia Sophia."_ said Presto

_"Yes... But there's CAI and SPAT teams enough doing their job trying to find him... I heard that even some Ultra Mentalists are trying to find him, but no one found him. And, to be fair, I think we need to do our job, and it is help people at Constantinople and then back to ORSL 7 for some more time and then, back ORSL 1."_ said Jiminy

_"Okay..."_ said Presto, when they saw Constantinople

---

The worst on removing debris and deal with the fatalities and casualties had gone. Constantinople was now Code Yellow, and that means that the CAI teams were working on shifts for finishing the cleaning work and so. Sugarplum was looking for her epad when Jiminy came.

_"Oh, sorry, Jiminy."_ she said when they both almost crashed on each other.

_"No problem. Looks like you're with lots of problems. What's happening?"_ he said

_"Is that Mardin guy: he passed some intel on some guys, most of them ready to defect the Caliphate, and they want to negotiate with LDS and UN a way to get out and get into the next elections."_ she said

_"So, they really want to put their agenda under democratic scrutiny. They are not radicalized?"_ said Jiminy

_"No... In fact, by the interviews LDS conducted on a classified site, they are really reasonable. They have their religious practices and agenda, but they aren't too much different of the right-winged guys in home. In fact, when you think on those morons from_ Pure God Work Fraternity, _these guys looks really sensible, and this is a thing."_ said Sugarplum

_"And what's the problem?"_ said Jiminy

_"As they want to negotiate, LDS needs to create a security structure, and they put us into this one... But we can't put our full power on this one: we still have some problems here, so we can't put the best ones..."_

_"Can I help? I had learned some Turkish, and I speak Arabic and some North African dialects. I can be a translator and help with my powers..."_

_"Sounds good: this can free some hands for security. I was thinking on Djanni doing this, but maybe you can help us this way. Okay... I think we can solve this one."_ said Sugarplum.

---

A week after, Jiminy was into a room with some guys, some of them on traditional desert clothes, other on suits. He was looking for one of the main guys on suits, a UN pin on his tie. Jiminy was focused on his translation job.

_"So... Mr. Mardin, I think those are the ones you said are leaders of a group into the_ Caliphate _that are ready for giving away the guerrilla against Constantinople and other places in North Africa, Maghreb and Middle East, right?"_ said the man

Jiminy did his job by translating and then translated back the response

_"He says those are some of his comrades at the Caliphate: Emarat Wassef, one of the main engineering guys; Samer Abo Hassoon, a tactician from the Sudan front; Marwan Alshamandi, part of the propaganda; and Mounir Fakhry Al-Yousif, from the politics."_ said Jiminy, presenting the guys

_"So... Let us start talking about this all: I believe you have some intel. We already took the flash-drives, papers and notes you brought us and they are being availed by our guys. So, let us discuss some terms on this thing."_ said the UN man

Jiminy needs to work his best with his powers: some of the topics on this all were really sensitive, things like _Eretz Israel_ and the situation of the Diaspora after the Caliphate War. Once and another Jiminy needed to use his _Pretty Please!_ to avoid the escalation on the negotiation. But, otherwise, everything was going okay.

Until...

Jiminy felt something wrong: his _Bellax Analytica_ engaged out of nothing.

_"Everyone, be ready!"_ he said.

It was when he heard a BADOOOM and the room trembling, some of the MaxBerets in the place helping everyone going safe.

_"Jiminy!"_ said Sugarplum _"What is this?"_

_"Someone is looking for those guys. Sugarplum, go on and help them get out. They are the target."_ said Jiminy

_"No way I'll leave you behind..."_ said Sugarplum, when they heard the ceil collapsing, and Jiminy being below the debris.

_"JIMINY!!!"_ screamed Sugarplum, and this was the last thing Jiminy heard before passing out...

... except someone saying: _"So, this is the Jiminy Cricket the Boss want to talk with."_

## Chapter 20

> _"When captured by the Ascendant, I was on one of the most terrible situations I had: I think that, at least for 4 years, I couldn't remember what was REALLY to be caught off-guard..."_
>
> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

Jiminy woke up, full of pain into what looked as a camp barrack: the hot, dry weather shown him he was no more at Constantinople.

_"Looks like a tango took me."_ thought Jiminy _"Blue Fairy, any intel?"_

He didn't heard the small voice on his mind.

This were when Jiminy started to panic.

He tried to focus on his _Bellax Analytica_, but he couldn't see the now familiar "shadows" of anyone or anything passing around.

_"What is happening?"_ he shouted

A voice on some speakers started to talk

_"You're our prisoner. Don't try anything weird if you want to be okay."_ said the voice, with a thick Arabic voice _"You had your powers removed, by Allah's (S.A.W.) honor, by one of your own,_ Zindiq."

Jiminy froze.

_"You have some time to undress yourself and put the clothes on the box on your left. There's water on the gourd nearby the entrance. No talk with anyone... I believe you understand what happened!"_ said the voice

Jiminy understood.

He had fallen under The Ascendant's hand. And on the Caliphate ones, by proxy.

---

_"Engaging Emergency Protocol Aleph-One!"_ said a synthetic voice on the helicopter speakers.

_"What is happening?"_ said Presto, that was sat into it, while everyone was put the guys safe on the bulletproof SUVs.

_"Presto!"_ said the now familiar voice of Blue Fairy _"God, or better, The Teatime Anarchist be glad! Something happened with Jiminy!"_

_"We know... But I thought you were with Jiminy."_ said Presto

_"The Aleph-One protocol is something I hid even from Jiminy. Never thought I would need to use it."_

_"And what is this?"_

_"No time: ask Sugarplum to be here, now!"_ said Blue Fairy, with a tense tone on her voice.

She were there in moments, including all the ORSL 1 team at ORSL 7.

_"What happened with Jiminy? Why you're still here, Blue Fairy."_ said Sugarplum _"Jiminy downloaded you?"_

_"No, and this is bad news: Aleph-One protocol was something the Teatime Anarchist put on my programs as an emergency. On laymen terms, I can download myself automatically into the last device I was downloaded if, for any reason, Jiminy was cut from his Quantum Link access."_ said Blue Fairy

_"Is he dead?"_ said Djanni

_"No... And this is the good news: if he was dead, I would not engaged Aleph-One. The Quantum Link would be broken, and I would be irremediable 'dead' also. Albeit he was cut from the Quantum Link, it is still operating, so it is still connected to Jiminy's brain, and so I'm here."_

_"Too much confusing..."_ said Presto

_"I know, and_ I was made _by T.A. And, before you talk, I'm not Shelly or Shell or even Shelly Boyar, the original one. Each of us has, or had, her own mind, although we share some knowledge, personality quirks and so."_

_"Alright..."_ said Sugarplum, trying to not freak out _"So, Jiminy wasn't just kidnapped, but somehow unlinked from you, at least temporally. So..."_

_"This mean that, somehow, they messed with his mind, cutting him from access to certain areas..."_ said Blue Fairy

_"His powers!"_ said Squirrel Girl "Bellax Analytica! Pretty Please! _And, on some level, you, Blue Fairy!"_ she said 

_"This means..."_ said Djanni

_"Jiminy is under the Ascendant's hand! And the Caliphate!"_ said Sugarplum _"And, unlike Alsyf Alayat's time, he's under his own, and without his powers!"_

_"I'll pass this to Soldaire."_ said Sugarplum _"I know it will be difficult to ask Soldaire for an authorization for an extraction: all Blue Fairy affair is classified, and we would need to reveal her to_ perhaps _have an authorization. I'll try to ask for information, before we do something."_

_"We should do something now!"_ said Djanni

_"No chance!"_ said Sugarplum _"Unless we go supervillain, there's no way to try to rescue Jiminy by now: it would be a war declaration against the Caliphate, and we all know how this would end."_

_"But..."_ said Djanni

_"We'll find a way to take Jiminy back. But we'll not gave to those nuts a reason to fight us back. Not in my watch, anyway."_ said Sugarplum

---

Jiminy had already received some food and allowed to get into toilet and take a bath. Those guys were rougher than the ones from when he was took by Alsyf Alayat, and now he doesn't have his powers for some reason, or better, thanks the Ascendant, and now he needed to be double careful on dealing with them.

It was when, he was sat into his small bunk bed on the tent they put him as a prison, two guys with scimitars and AK-47s at the door, a guy came into. He was dressed into a big desert walker set of clothes, some _Lawrence of Arabia_-ish clothes and using a kind of pair of glasses over his eyes. Jiminy couldn't distinguish him from anything he remembered from his breakthrough-powered mind (the only thing The Ascendant could not block from him), but he look someone Caucasian, or at least not someone from the region.

_"So, you're Joshua McCarthy..."_ said the guy

_"And you are The Ascendant."_ said Jiminy, noticing who was this guy _"But you're not trying to play fair: on this one, you're even worse than Alsyf Alayat."_

_"You're right."_ said the guy _"I have nothing against you, Jiminy Cricket, or_ Herós Sans Frontières, per se. _In fact, I like you somehow: you're not that kind of crime-fighting heroes from the old time comics, but you're more like public service."_

_"And why you took me? And why blocking my powers?"_ said Jiminy

_"Think this as a safety measure: I couldn't deal okay with you using your powers, but those guys outside would kill you as soon as they noted your_ Pretty Please! _But, as far they saw you had no powers anymore, they chose to allow you to stay alive, at least by now."_

_"And why you are working on this for them?"_ 

_"What do you think about_ Eretz Israel?" said the Ascendant

Jiminy knew enough about _Eretz Israel_, even more that half his time on _Herós Sans Frontières_ was dealing with the consequences about it.

_"I think that all of this was a great problem and that people should discuss more and kill less."_ said Jiminy

_"For a kid that killed someone in the past..."_ said The Ascendant

_"I know... And I think on and regret this all the time."_ said Jiminy

_"Even now? Had you thought that all breakthroughs are, in fact, a source of power?"_

_"This is fact. After all,_ 'a breakthrough..." was saying Jiminy, when The Ascendant said

"...is a natural response against a stressful or life-threating situation'. _The_ Barlow's _yadda-yadda. But I'm not talking on this. Breakthroughs are a kind of material power, and no matter what, they can be exerted for political things. The_ original _Caliphate was an example: it was a Breakthrough that manipulated the military and political forces against Israel that time. And Israel fought back."_

_"Monroe Doctrine?"_ said Jiminy _"And what about The Nuke?"_

_"No one knows what really happened on Tel-Aviv: what is known is that it was a dirty bomb, and that it destroyed Tel-Aviv, that now is forbidden zone, and it will be for the next 30 years."_ said The Ascendant

_"And do you believe that the Israeli did this?"_ said Jiminy

_"This is what_ I _want to ask you, Jiminy Cricket."_ said The Ascendant. _"And remember you're being monitored."_

_"So, his idea is to make me killed by the Caliphate as a enemy warrior after saying that it was one of them, but also to turn me against Israeli guys if say the other way._ Seki". thought Jiminy, thinking on the _go_ situation where playing could result in defeat _"Great trap... Nice try, The Ascendant."_

_"What I can say is that was a humanitarian crime, no matter who did it. I think the one who did this could also be a lone wolf, to be shunned to anyone that has the minimum of civility, and also I think that, no matter what happened, we have the here and now to do what we can to help the people who suffered on all this. And this is my mission as a_ Herós Sans Frontières _cape. This was the decision I did after almost being killed by bullies, after six months under a coma, in that hospital bed."_ said Jiminy, calmly, and he was happy to see that he catched The Ascendant red-handed on his intentions.

_"Well... Looks I could not suppress your breakthrough-powered brain totally."_ said The Ascendant _"Looks like I found a limit on my powers..."_ he said before stopping abruptly.

_"No need to stop... After what you did with Astra this was an open secret."_

_"Maybe I should had killed Astra... Maybe I shall kill you to avoid this secret to leak... Maybe not..."_ thought The Ascendant.

_"I know your philosophy."_ said Jiminy _"Read your profile enough: you think breakthrough is a way to 'natural' selection for a new kind of mankind."_

_"So, you know..."_

_"...you can trigger the breakthrough on those who you want, and enhance or suppress breakthrough powers."_ said Jiminy

The Ascendant looked a little worried.

_"Sounds like it's the first time you are taken off-guard."_ said Jiminy

_"Yeah... I think that we are somewhat likewise: we work into the realm of_ soft powers. _You see, the lion's share of all breakthroughs are based on hard power: Ajaxes and Atlas can destroys things by their own hands, like Dragons also. Merlins and Mentalist can kill people manipulating subatomic energies or other invisible ways and so. But you, and me, we don't need to kill... Killing is dirty and counterproductive, you know: we can extract the better of everyone, just pushing the right buttons and turning the right knobs. We are_ soft power. _This gave us an edge to go off-radar for the big bricks, but we are shunned on what we can do, until we do."_ said The Ascendant

_"And now... Why working with_ The Caliphate?" said Jiminy

_"I just made the same offer I did for everyone else: power, no strings attached."_ said The Ascendant _"Yeah, I know about all the events involving Grendel and Ozma, and I know you know both of them and their origin powers. But I noticed it was very counterproductive to just let people develop powers under this. What we need now is to give power and let nature works..."_

_"So, you believe evolution is based on power? Just by that?"_ 

"'Survival of the fittest', _as said by Darwin."_ said The Ascendant

_"But even Darwin recognized that 'fittest' was a environment-based feature. So, someone on a certain environment can be extremely fit and could be on trouble on another just some kilometers away. Australia is one the greatest examples on how this idea of_ stronger equals fittest _is nonsense: Australian native fauna has lots of problem to live outside Australia."_

_"And how could you solve those problems?"_ asked the Ascendant

_"No simple answer, unfortunately: believe me, I would love to have some off-the-shelf answers, it would make my life so much easier... But, in fact, we are humans, and our variety is what, in my opinion, turned us so important, if so, in nature. I know that this brought war and problems, but I read somewhere that those are our world birth pain... And..."_ said Jiminy, feeling a heartache _"This is why I became a_ Herós Sans Frontières _cape: because I could not accept that people suffered what I suffered on that alley years ago. I don't believe in_ Might makes Right. _And if this is the fate of the world, I'll fight it until I die, but I'll not be part of this."_ he say

The Ascendant could see his look: he was a still a kid, had some tears on his eyes, but has a powerful voice and a determination that was not part of his powers.

_"You're somewhat a marvel."_ said The Ascendant _"Hope they allow you to live..."_ he said, while going way from the tent, leaving Jiminy thinking by himself.

## Chapter 21

> _"I still believe that the tango's focus on taking Jiminy is not just because he is the least-powered one of us, but because they_ fear _his power: he can call upon your conscience, and lots of things would be difficult or even impossible to be done if you think on the consequences. This is an incredible power, and give this to a kid just turn things even worse for the bad guys."_

> **_Andre_ "Dumont" _Macedo, "Histories from the_ Demoiselle - _My Breakthrough Memoirs"_**

Just 24 hours passed until Soldaire called everyone for video-conference:

_"Alright..."_ said Soldaire _"LDS and UN had a meeting some hours ago. They'll go for Darfur_ Caliphate _guys..."_

_"Great..."_ was saying Djanni

_"But we'll not be allowed to get with them."_ said Soldaire _"And I had some report on this: it will be a storm operation. They think they already had intel enough for a suppresive action against them."_

_"But... Jiminy is without powers! He'll be killed for sure!"_ gasped Sugarplum 

_"I hope not..."_ said Soldaire, and everyone could see he was tired. _"I said them they had one of us hostage, and they said they'll do their best to rescue Jiminy, but I don't know... I already talked with the McCarthys to prepare them for the worst..."_

_"Let us think positively."_ said Marjanah _"Jiminy is smart: even without his powers, he is experienced by what you talked about him."_

_"But... With_ Freaking Ascendant _with the_ Caliphate _it'll be a blood bath!"_ said Squirrel Girl.

_"Yeah... And is The Ascendant presence there that made the UN and LDS forces choose for an all-out attack now."_ said Soldaire _"There's a chance to catch some big fish on the process."_ said Soldaire.

_"But..."_ said Djanni

_"I was outvoted."_ said Soldaire _"In fact: we from HSF was outvoted. Some of us will be delocated for nearby Darfur to give help. I asked Diana for it, and I think Prop and Colocation will be on it. I asked to put some of you, but they decided it would be risky. Hufflepuff and Kuntur will be there for us..."_ 

Hufflepuff and Kuntur were two of the main Bricks from ORSL 1 team, beside LionHeart, Soldaire and Djanni.

_"To finish, let us hope for the best and be ready for the worst..."_ said Soldaire _"Off.."_

Djanni looked worried

_"He'll be saved, Djanni. Believe in Allah The Most High (S.A.W). Even he being an infidel, Allah will be with him, as he always worked by peace. 'We have appointed a law and a practice for every one of you. Had God willed, He would have made you a single community, but He wanted to test you regarding what has come to you. So compete with each other in doing good. Every one of you will return to God and He will inform you regarding the things about which you differed.'_ Surat al-Ma’ida, _the fifth_ Sura, _Verse 48. Jiminy had done lots of good... Allah  The Forgiving (S.A.W) will relieve him on his suffering. For us now is to pray for the best."_ said Marjanah.

_"Thanks... I was a fool..."_ said Djanni

_"No... You were a man fearing for his friend."_ said Marjanah _"But this is just the kind of time we need to trust Allah The Forgiving (S.A.W) even more, as He Is The One Who Knows All"_

"Maktub." said Djanni

Jiminy was dressed on the same desert clothes he was forced to use since the time he came there. He was given a fast tour all around, to show him he could not escape: even with his powers, there was almost a battalion of the _Mujaheddin_, the fanatic warriors there. He saw then something to save in his memory: into a big tent there was a lot of women, many of them just a little older than himself.

_"They are our wives."_ said the one who conducted him, with the AK-47 on his hand _"They are war spoil for us."_

_"From_ Roque Santeiro?" asked Jiminy in Arabic, avoiding English to not cross this guy

_"Some... Other from some stray groups we took in the desert."_

Jiminy thought on reply about the man dead, but he remembered he could not precog the guy reaction without _Bellax Analytica_. He could not believe how much he felt like being naked without his powers.

It was when, while he was eating, he heard a siren calling attention, and some distress everywhere. He heard voices exclaiming in Arabic _"The Crusaders had come!"_ and other talks, in Berber and other Northern African idioms. 

It was when one of his guards came to him:

_"Come with me, now!"_ said the guy.

_"What..."_ Jiminy was saying, when he saw a FAL rifle pointed to him.

_"No talk..."_ said the guy, and looked worried

Jiminy just got out the tent, and he saw that all the men were going to the front. The guy touched his back with the gun point, showing that he would be pushed to the battlefield...

And it was when he felt a small whistle, and his experience made him made a movement getting out the way.

The bomb shrapnels got the guy straight into the chest, and Jiminy was alive just by experience and sheer luck. But he just looked to the guy in deadly pain and asked:

_"Your name?"_

_"Ahmed Nader Maroun..."_ said the guy, when his eyes gone opaque, his life going away.

Jiminy closed his eyes, did a small prayer for him, and looked around.

_"A probability window!"_ he thought, taking the rifle and the ammo from the fallen _Mujaheddin_ and running to the opposite side.

He was walking fast, avoiding the most the way the other _Caliphate_ Warriors were using. He didn't need his _Bellax Analytica_ to remember the site structure: his memory was enough. 

He got and walk through, looking for the women tent and for a way to get away there. He knew there's two choppers somewhere, and he could catch one of them with some luck. 

As he got to the women tent, they looked for them. Some of them were really scared:

_"The camp is under attack. If you want to try to scape, it's a chance."_ he said in Arabic.

_"Who are you?"_ said one of them

_"Not time for this: I'm a friend, so to speak. But there's no time to waste for."_ said Jiminy _"Take clothes, water and let us get out of here."_

The women start to run with small bundles of clothes and some canteels of water.

It was just when Jiminy start to hear the screams _"yuhribun mae alnisa'!"_ 

_"Let's go!"_ said Jiminy, using some of the tactics thought to him by the BKA, using the auto-fire mode to make some suppresive fire, making them take cover.

They were going to the place were the helicopter was, when they found some _Mujaheddin_ and they start to shoot. It was when one of the woman look for them and, waving her hands like she was doing some belly dance send a small sand storm against them, making them cough and go blind

_"Who are you?"_ said Jiminy

_"Mirian Cissé"_ said the woman

_"First things first: how you did this?"_

_"Don't know!"_ said Mirian _"I just thought on the stories and did like Scheherazade!"_

When Jiminy saw the women going for them, he said:

_"Just knock them out. Take weapons and ammo, but no kill!"_

The five _Mujaheddin_ were knocked out.

They got nearby the heliport.

_"Now, Mirian, let us take those guys away. We'll take the helicopter, and we try to run away."_

_"How?"_

_"I pilot helicopters. I'm from_ Herós Sans Frontières. _Jiminy Cricket is my capename."_

_"Alright!"_ said Mirian, locking on the ammo from her rifle.

They started to shot and pushing those guys away, and Mirian used her recent breakthrough power to push those guys away using their sand attacks.

_"Alright!"_ said Jiminy, when all those guys had run away, and they gone to the helicopter. _"Let's go!"_

Jiminy sat into the pilot seat, Mirian on the copilot.

_"I miss you, Blue Fairy."_ said Jiminy

_"Blue Fairy?"_ said Mirian

_"I'll talk later... If we survive this."_ said Jiminy, starting the helicopter and simultaneously doing some Morse Code into a common LDS frequency.

"JIMINY CRICKET. IN THE HELI. NEED COVER." was the message.

_"Hope they find the message."_ said Jiminy, while lighting the motor on...

---

_"We have a message on common frequency, sir. Morse code, small potency, into the greeting frequency."_ said one of the man in the command center

_"What?"_ said the man _"Who would use Morse Code into our greeting frequency. Small potency means it came from the theatre."_

_"Right... The message says_ JIMINY CRICKET. IN THE HELI. NEED COVER." said the man with the radio

_"Jiminy is there! And alive!"_ said the man with the big Andine costume.

_"Yeah... But we can't take this for sure."_ said the commander to the guy  _"This can easily be a trap. We can't put any afford on this."_

_"And leave_ Pepito Grillo _for death? Fat chance,_ señor." said the other guy, dressed into a _Lucha Libre_ costume

_"Commander Williams,"_ said the black, statuesque woman, in military fatigues and holding a big and heavy spear as weapon _"can you lock the signal? And send back the message in Morse Code_ USE ORSL 1 FREQ."

_"Lt. Matheusź?"_ said the Commander.

_"Sir, the signal is from somewhat 3 clicks from here, 10 hours."_ said the man _"I'll send the message back, ma'am, but I..."_

_"Don't worry with us."_ said Diana, looking for the other HSF capes there _"Our mission here is to rescue our cape Jiminy Cricket, acquire the rogue breakthrough The Ascendant and fight the Caliphate, this order. We'll not interfere on your main mission of acquiring the site and neutralize the tangos."_

_"Hope so."_ said Commander _"If you interfere, you'll be considered a tango as much the Caliphate guys."_

_"Believe us... We don't want to mess with you."_ said Diana, while the communication guy send the message back.

---

Jiminy heard the Morse Code message getting back and had a smile, while the rotor got speed

_"ORSL 1 frequency!"_ said Jiminy in english, while taking the walkie talkie. _"They are coming for help us!"_

_"What?"_ said Mirian

_"We'll have help!"_ said Jiminy, in Arabic. _"My friends are getting here."_ he said, while adjusting the frequency.

_"ORSL 1, LDS forces, Jiminy Cricket here!"_ he said _"I have some Caliphate hostages with me on a MI heli... Looks like a Mi-38"_

_"Right."_ said the potent woman voice.

_"Diana!"_ said Jiminy. _"Take care: The Ascendant is here."_

_"We know: if possible, he's a designated target."_ 

_"We need a safe pass... We'll takeoff now!"_ said Jiminy, when he looked for the instruments, showing he's on operational speed.

He started to take off, when he felt a bump trying to push him down.

_"Look out!"_ said another woman, and they felt some heat.

Jiminy looked outside, and there was a guy in flames, big and bold. And somewhat away:

_"The Ascendant!"_ said Jiminy, trying to avoid roll over _"He upgraded this guy!"_

_"What we should do?"_ said one of the women

_"Miriam, shoot some sand on him!"_ said Jiminy

_"Right!"_ she said, and shot the sand...

But it wasn't effective: the flames on the guy turned the sand into micro-glass

_"We're in trouble here!"_ said Jiminy to the walkie talkie. _"If you want to help, we need your help NOW!"_ 

_"We're a go, Jiminy!"_ said Diana _"Stay on your position!"_

_"We're doing our best!"_ said Jiminy, when the guy turned a little more the helicopter. _"Hold yourself!"_

One of the woman screamed, and pulled her hand to protect herself from the flames that was trying to get into the helicopter.

It was when they felt the heat reducing!

_"What is happening?"_ said the woman, looking her hands glowing into a blue light, looking like sucking the flames.

_"Breakthrough!"_ said Jiminy _"Think on push the flames back to the guy, or better, against it_ and _the man behind it!"_ 

_"Okay!"_ said the girl, and the flame that gone from the woman hit the guy on the side.

But it was _blue_ fire, that by the pain reaction the guy had, it was really hurtful. The Ascendant had time to get away, but this broke the amplification he did and he run away.

_"Let's go!"_ said Jiminy, controlling the helicopter and flying away as fast he could, with the guy run behind them, shooting flames. _"Close the doors!"_ 

The women closed the helicopter doors and they felt some of the flames crossing aside them.

_"Jiminy, we have you on visual!"_ said Diana

_"Diana, The Ascendant had evaded... This tango we have on our tail looks like an Ajax/Pyrokinetic. A-Class, upgraded by The Ascendant. Take him as Ultra or even Omega!"_

_"Roger... Just get away: you have rescued people. Let this for us."_

_"Okay."_ said Jiminy, pushing the heli

---

Diana could see the Helicopter get over herself. She changed to the LDS frequency.

_"Diana here: don't shoot the heli that crossed us. I repeat: don't shoot it. It is one of us!"_ said Diana

_"Roger."_ said Lt. Matheusź _"Sending it a route back safely our side through the accorded frequency."_

_"Right. We'll drop this monster."_ said Diana, switching off the comms

_"Need to say,_ muchacha, _it'll be easier said than done."_ said Hufflepuff

_"Afraid, Hufflepuff?"_ said LionHeart

_"Me?_ Hufflepuff, Hijo del Estupendo Tolot? Corazón de Leon, nada me amedrenta. _I'm afraid of Nothing, LionHeart!"_

_"No time for bravado, you two."_ said the British-American guy, using a green jersey with a kind of antelope on it, a H and a rugby ball on it also. His head had a scrum cap used on rugby, his teeth protected by a black mouth-guard. _"Let us drop that thing down and get home."_

_"For sure."_ said the Chinese woman with him, holding a pair of brass _tonfa_, with some sparkles of electricity getting out. _"Now, let us go."_ said Colocation, giving the honors by attacking first.

She used her teleporting and give some kick, that made some of the flames getting away from him, hitting straight in the side.

_"Okay... Sounds like my powers are somewhat effective to him."_ said her.

_"Let now to me!"_ said Prop, running ready to tackle the guy, but he had just pulled him away with his arm.

_"Prop!"_ said Colocation

_"I'm okay!"_ said Prop.

_"My time."_ said Diana, hitting a button on her spear. "VENTO GÉLIDO!"

She threw the Vernetech spear that hit the guy in the shoulder and sent a bout of frozen air.

_"Alright..."_ said Diana _"Looks like this will do with the flames: Kuntur, Prop, Hufflepuff, he is all yours."_

_"Let's go!"_ said Kuntur, going like a missile and hitting the guy straight in the chest, making him lose her breath.

_"Now, Hufflepuff!"_ said Kuntur, getting back and tagging his hand.

Hufflepuff looked for the guy and said:

"Usted está condenado! Yo, Hufflepuff, Hijo de Tolot, le daré tu condena!" he said, running to it and punching him again in the same spot Kuntur did. The guy tried to reignite his fire, but it wasn't successful, and Hufflepuff took him.

"És hora de tu condena! EL TÉJON VOLADOR!" he screamed, throwing him to the air.

The guy tried to protect himself from the attack, but it wasn't successful, when Hufflepuff locked his throat with his powerful legs, and he smashed him into a lariat in the ground.

The guy was stopped.

_"They are coming!"_ shouted Kuntur, that was flying over everyone, looking around. Lots of _Mujaheddin_ from the Caliphate where coming. Then they looked for the _Zindiq_ that were there, and for the guy in the ground, knocked out.

_"Alright."_ said Diana, in Arabic _"I'm pissed off enough to kill at least two or three of you morons."_ snapping her fingers. _"So... This is simple: I'll count to three. Everyone here after that will be tangos to be neutralized. Each of you that shoot against me will be considered target to take down. So... One..."_ she started to count

In three, some smarty guys stayed, and Diana took one of them to use as a baton against other four. Hufflepuff throw one of them against a small group that was running away. Kuntur flew around and used his arms to pull some of them out of the way, while Prop tackled a lot of them and Colocation used her combination of teleporting and Jeet-Kune Do to drop the remaining rabble to the ground.

_"Diana here."_ said her in the Earbug _"We cleaned this sector. Where are you, Jiminy?"_

_"Already in the command center."_ said him _"Need a ride?"_

_"It would be good, thanks."_ said Diana, almost smiling with her ivory white smile, her afro hair shining with the sweat from the fight _"Need to say, I need to thank those_ Mujaheddin: _it was good to do some anger management with those guys. I was so pissed off with those guys since_ Roque Santeiro _attack it was good to kick some asses."_

_"Alright: there's still some fuel for a there and back again travel."_ said Jiminy

---

Jiminy was being checked by a LDS doctor for his conditions, while talking with the others.

_"So, The Ascendant took you just to talk?"_ said Diana

_"I don't know: maybe he wanted to use me as guinea pig, or needed to take me to prove what he could to the Caliphate."_ said Jiminy _"Anyway..."_

_"And in the chaos you got away."_ said Prop

_"Yeah... But need to say that I had help... Those two girls, including Ms. Mirian Cissé, had breakthroughs in the right moments. And the others were very helpful too."_

_"Right..."_ said the LDS doctor _"You're okay to go. Please wait a minute while we get some clothes for you."_

They were getting out, after Jiminy dressed some soldier clothes, when he saw Mirian Cissé getting out from another medical tent.

_"Hey, Ms. Cissé..."_ said Jiminy, and she looked to him _"By chance: have you a parent called Wahiba?"_

_"My sister! My elder sister!"_ said her _"But... How you..."_

_"Long story. But good news, you're going to see her back."_ said Jiminy _"We are with her!"_

_"Lo, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful!"_ she said, crying _"She was taken forcibly as a wife in my place. She was raped a lot..."_

_"I know..."_ said Jiminy _"She had a horrible story. But now, she's better, and she's a breakthrough like you."_

_"Breakthrough?"_ said Mirian

_"She had powers, like you, and some others... We'll talk better when getting back to her."_

_"But how?"_ said her

Jiminy thought a little and saw that the Commander of the operation was there:

_"Sir, have you a time? I want to ask you a favor."_ said Jiminy

---

_"I still can't believe you asked this for them."_ said Diana, smiling

_"Well... It wasn't like I wanted a gift: we could take this as war spoil."_ said Jiminy, on the lever of the same helicopter he got from the Caliphate.

_"This will be way cool in ORSL 1, you know."_ said Kuntur.

_"I was just thinking on this."_ said Jiminy, when he felt something weirdly familiar.

_"What's happening?"_ said Kuntur, noticing Jiminy

_"Just..._ Pretty Please, _Kuntur, could you give me a chocolate milk?"_ said Jiminy

Kuntur ran to the rack and took a thermos, when he noticed what happened.

_"Your powers! Are they back?"_ said Kuntur

_"Yep... At least my_ Bellax Analytica _and my_ Pretty Please!" said Jiminy, when he felt another good presence, a giggling one. _"Blue Fairy!"_

_"Hey, short stuff, long time no see."_ said the small Fairy, in the same costume he saw her in the first time.

_"You can't believe how much I missed you."_ said Jiminy

_"I can see... Remember: I can read your mind somewhat."_ said Blue Fairy

_"Cheater."_ said Jiminy

_"How this is happening?"_ said Hufflepuff.

_"Think he didn't push too much on me: as my powers are not for direct combat, he took me as a kid."_ said Jiminy _"Well, being small and meek has some advantages..."_ he said, and everyone laugh.

It was when they saw the HSF base at Constantinople. 

_"Home sweet home, Jiminy!"_ said Blue Fairy.

_"Home sweet home, Blue Fairy!"_ said Jiminy _"Constantinople HSF Base, Jiminy Cricket with the Darfur HSF team and some Caliphate hostage rescued."_ 

## Chapter 22

> "I lost my powers for just some days and I really felt myself naked. Being back intot he field with my dear friends was a relief."
>
> **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

Some days passed while Jiminy and the others finised their job at Constantinople, the Hagia Sofia situation now back to a Code Blue situation. There was two girls with some mild _Sword Verses_ post-hypnotic suggestions, but Squirrel Girl undone them and they were free to get back _Roque Santeiro_. Mirian stayed, with the other breakthrough woman, to reinforce ORSL 1 team as sidekicks. Scheherazade (real name: Mirian Cissé) was a sand projector/kinetic, B-Class at least, that could also change herself into a sand form that allowed her to "fly" as a small sandstorm and cross through sand. The other girl, that choosed the capename _Lahab_ (real name: Khadija Rezgui), was a thermal projector that could suck and redirect flames and other sources of heat. She was not a kinetic, so she needed a source of heat, but as long as she had something to provide the heat (in extreme cases, living things), she could project it away in many ways.

_"Two good powers for our team."_ said Soldaire via video-conference _"And is very cool that Scheherazade and Marjanah are sisters."_

_"Yeah."_ said Jiminy _"And we rescued many of the people that were alive from the_ Roque Santeiro _attack."_ 

_"Sure..."_ said Marjanah _"But I think this is not the last time we heard about The Undying Caliphate and The Ascendant."_

_"I don't think so."_ said Sugarplum _"We still didn't find the Ascendant and some of those guys he certainly gave or upgrade powers: the Ultra weather controller from the ORSL 1, the Terrakinetic that did the Hagia Sofia earthquake..."_

_"But this is not for us..."_ said LionHeart _"We already have our mission at ORSL 1."_

_"Yeah..."_ said Presto _"But how we'll take those helis back home?"_ 

_"Presto, I believe you took your helicopter brief, right?"_ said Jiminy. 

_"Yeah."_

_"So, you take Transport 4 and I bring our new Trasport 5."_ said Jiminy

_"Right... Just because we have a smaller autonomy than you"_ said Presto, sneering

_"I'll have the bulk of the things to bring back ORSL 1, including the rescued woman. And you'll go more confy, as just Hufflepuff and LionHeart will go with you."_

_"Right, right."_ said Presto

---

Back to ORSL 7, it was time to farewells.

_"Thanks everything, Jiminy."_ said Prop

_"Just doing my job, Prop. Hope you have a better time. And if you need us, just ask."_ said Jiminy

_"Stay training, Presto."_ said Colocation _"Remember you need this to be better for your team."_

_"Yes,_ sifu."_ said Presto, while putting his headset.

_"Right, Blue Fairy."_ said Jiminy _"Give me support, while LionHeart give support for Presto."_

_"Aye, aye, Sir!"_ said Blue Fairy, while they started the helicopters

_"ORSL 1 Transports 4 and 5 departuring."_ said Jiminy _"On levers, Jiminy Cricket and Presto."_

_"ORSL 1 Transports 4 and 5, ORSL 7 here. Godspeed."_ 

_"Thanks... Out."_ said Jiminy, while both the helicopters were in the air.

_"Now... Six hours until home?"_ said Presto

_"Yep."_ said Jiminy. _"Lucky the weather is good: normally we would never do a thing like this, but it's necessary. Blue Fairy will help us both. I'll go straight to ORSL 1, deliver everyone, and encounter you at ORSL 3, to split the remaining cargo and passengers."_

_"Alright."_ said Presto

_"And maybe I'll bring Cabby with me: he can help us a lot."_ said Jiminy _"If I knew what would happen, I would bring Cabby with us."_

_"No one could think all this would happen."_ said Djanni _"By now, we need to get back, take some time to relax a little and then... Back to action and our life."_

_"And you, Jiminy?"_ said Sugarplum _"I think you want get back some time with your parents."_

_"Right... And need to look for my University grads."_

_"Thinking on what, Jiminy?"_ said Squirrel Girl

_"I was thinking on a major on Law, with minors on IT, Electronics, Languages, Politics, and Philosophy."_ said Jiminy

_"WOAH, kid!"_ said Sugarplum _"Easy! You'll not have time for all this! You're taking a too big of a bite on this."_

_"Hey, I'm 15 and already finished college."_ said Jiminy _"I can take my time. Besides, all this will help us in the field, and this will be easy peasy with my mind. In fact, all this Ascendant thing shown me that my brain is what I have to cherished the most, as my intelligence and memory were breakthrough-amplified, but they are my own now..."_

_"Yeah..."_ said Sugarplum 

_"Hey, you boring kid! Don't fawn over your so mighty brains and stay looking forward. There a storm forming!"_ said Blue Fairy.

_"Alright... Just 10 degrees and we are out of the way, by the avionics."_ said Jiminy _"Let us go back home."_

_"Yes."_ said everyone, happy to a mission accomplished.
