## History

Wandering Bee loves plants and animals, but she loves bees the most. She thinks bees are wonderful role models and that we should take care of them. Knowing all there is to know about bees, she has learned to communicate with them and earn their trust, making her the next in line to tend the Hive tree, the shared network of honey. Avid reader, scholar, and student.
