Since it's opening, there's a small apartment hidden at Disneylad, on the Firehouse at Main Street. This apartment was used by Walt Disney, to see his dreams growing and growing. With time and Walt Disney passing, a lamp was placed to show that Disney spirit is still there, looking upon to maintain and raise Disney Magic.

Some special few people knows that this is even truther than people could think:

At December 15th, 1976, some people had gone to look for Walt's apartment periodic refurbish, when they saw a man that... There was no other way to describe... looked like jumped straight from _Sorcerer's Apprentice_ sequence from _Fantasia_: a strong, non-nonsense face with big white beard and hair, using blue robes and a certain, very iconic hat.

It was when he revealed himself for some of the managers as _Yen Sid_, Master Magician and Herald of _Disney Magic_, that came from another reality where the Disney Magic was supressed by an evil, dystopian version of US government, that supressed all kind of magic and hapiness beside an ultrapatriotism that forced US into a perpetual war by heating the Cold War until there was only _War!_ against everyone else, the pacifist and dissident voices crushed like a pulp.

_Yen Sid_ had then used his magics to avoid being catched by some of his enemies from another dimension, coming till that one. Where he discovered that many things that resulted on his dystopian reality already happened, like the Century Club disbanding, although other had not happened.

Like Disney being so well-succeeded and made some inspiring place like Walt Disney World and Disneyland.

He decided to stay here: he believe that his magics could not bring him back his home dimension, so he only can believe that it was reduced to oblivion. And this would not happen on this place.

And to do this, he would help to grow Disney dream of peace and laughter.

Although his strong, serious, non-nonsense face, he has a so big heart that he run everywhere, looking for people in need of help. He try to do his best, even knowing that not all places accept his _Disney Magic_ (he calls it this way). He can, however, be fierce and even furious on the right (Wrong?) place and time, and those rare people that saw him on this could see he is fire and fury when people mess with his mission.

He can be found at Disney Parks, where he can just Teleport from one another using some magics and gateways unknown for everyone except a very rare few (Eisner included), and he works by improving the Disney Magic, either by helping training new Cast Members to hearing and supporting the _Imagineers_ to using his magics (that he uses only in the direst circunstances).

## Notes

As the _Spirits_ and _Shadows_, _Yen Sid_ can raise the VHS level of a region. However, this is limited by some geographic bounds (specially those related with Disney parks)

## Disney Magic (Gonzo) Role

_Disney Magic_. Since the past this is the term used by some on how use reality to bring fantasy to life. Walt Disney was one of the best on this art. Not all shows were commercial success, at least at opening: _Alice in Wonderland_ and _Fantasia_ are the main examples of those. However, Disney Magic became more than an idea.

Those who uses _Disney Magic_, normally called _Imagineers_, dance in the blade of VHS to do impossible things with the possible. They look forward and advance technique and technology to the skies to bring magic to life.


+ *__Skills:__ Knowledge, Gadgetry, Awareness, Insight*

This last case, he is obliged to put some **escape clause** that is plausible to be undergone so the target can get away from it_. (Yen Sid uses _Disney Magic_ role for this)

## Disney Cast Role (Gonzo)



+ _**Skills:** Knowledge, Awareness, Persuade, Insight_

## Disney Casting Gonzo Stunt

+ _**It's a Jolly Holliday (LVL 1):** When buying this, choose one of those skills, as far there's part of your Roles Skill: Knowledge, Awareness, Persuade. You can use them instead of Insight to Create Advantages by discovering Aspects related on what would make people happy_
+ _**Hot Dogs! (LVL 2):** You can immerse yourself into the character you are associated for: it combos the Stunts_ A Likely Story _and_ Seems Legit. _Good News: you roll only if Persuade is less than opposition+2. However, as soon you "reveal" an Aspect as by_ A Likely Story, _it can be Invoked or Forced against you for narrative, as it was one of the Character Aspects (for example, a White Rabbit can be Forced into his **I'm Late for a very Important Date** to be confused on what to do). This stays during the scene it was generated or until removed with a Will roll, dificulty being the Persuade level of the character_
+ _**Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! (LVL 3):** This is a really overwhelming Stunt: to activate it, aside any other costs, the character needs to suffer a Consequence_ "Under the Character", _the level indicating how far this Stunt still be held on: Mild for a Scene, Moderate for a Episode, Severe for a Movie (you can't make this goes during a full Season or during a Series). But the power can compensate: first by doing this, the PC sends the local VHS around him to 3 automatically, and any try to reduce VHS by Shadows could be done only if they roll against the character Will as a Contest. Second: during the power use, the PC choose two Setting Aspects representing new truths in the setting, that can override almost any other Aspects beside those from Shadows or Methuselah Fragments. The GM can choose a_ Trouble _Aspect also. Third: any Aspect generated on montages that can be linked to the Character the PC is associated for can be invoked for +3 instead for +2 per boost/FP. This can't be used again while the character is "healing" the_ "Under the Character" _Consequence, and he can only start to heal the Consequence as soon this use expires. To finish, the character can make people getting into his "fantasy", treating them as Mooks with a **Good (+3)** level Aspect related to the character (example: a Peter Pan character can turn people around into **Lost Boys**). The Effects passes as far the PC is took out from a Conflict or is knock out or rendered unconscious on any way_
