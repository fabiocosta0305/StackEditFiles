## History

Donkey Teeth dresses like a ninja, mostly in black, but with slightly ostentatious splashes of color. She doesn’t dress to be sneaky or inconspicuous, but to make her face covering (a bandana with a cat’s mouth painted on it) slightly less out of place. Her short hair is bright red in the spring and summer, and changes to a cool violet in fall and winter. She also has her trademark permanent grin and shark-like teeth.

When she was still small, Donkey Teeth’s parents -- wealthy, respected, and powerful people -- failed to offer due hospitality to a travelling commoner. Said commoner was actually a god from the nearby Heaven of Spice and Jade, and cursed Donkey Teeth with her inhuman smirk as revenge for the smirk that her father gave before closing the door on the traveller. She was sent to the Flying Temple to keep the embarrassment out of sight.
