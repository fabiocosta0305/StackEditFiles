## Stunts

+ ___Luck of the Leprechauns:___ Because I have the luck of the leprechauns, I gain +2 when I Flashily defend against physical attacks, traps, or hazards.
+ ___Mad as a March Hare!:___ _Once per session_, he can give it up for the Hare and become somewhat like a beastial Rabbitman  on a Conflict. He does this to give a Faith Dice as Demon Dice for the GM. While on this, he receive a Mild Condition ___Mad as a March Hare!___, and gain +4 on all combat-focused rolls, and -2 on any non-combat-focused roll. At the end of the conflict, the Condition is renamed ___Exhausted___. This dice is rolled as Damage against me.
