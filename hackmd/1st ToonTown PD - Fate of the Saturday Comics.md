# 1st ToonTown PD - Fate of the Saturday Comics

## Introduction

> "Alright, son... Think this is your first day here. Hope your uniform is alright. And this include the rabbit ears. What? Are you thinking I'm joking? Now listen, son, when a crazy toon throws a hundred tons anvil against you, those ears can be a better protection than an armor, a hat or even a gun.
> 
> I can say this on my own: one of that crazy guys from the _No Good Alley_ throw an axe against me, directly to my chest. I put a Portable Hole on it and the damn thing just got outside my back. I got unharmed, but Mousekewitz was the one that paid the price. Don't worry: he's okay now, but it was a little difficult to bring two halves of a mouse back the district.
>
> Now you understand, right? Stay with those ears by now. Believe me: soon you won't need this anymore, as soon you get used with all the craziness here.
>
> This is the _1st Toontown Police District_, part of _Los Angeles Police Department_. It has just some years, though: before the toons always dealt things by themselves. But with all the recent mess, and with more humans getting into Toontown everyday, the big guys saw it would be a good idea to put a Police District: believe me, you'll not want to cross Tinkerbell and see how she'll solve things with fairy dust when you go overboard.
>
> She's not bad, however: in fact, she's very cool. Just go smooth with her.
>
> Maybe you heard all the yada-yada the big guys founded the District, all about the... How they said... Ah! _"The selflessness and dedication from the heroes of law that do big efforts to uphold Law and maintain Peace and Order and the Good Neighborhood at Toontown."_ Let's get real, only three types of people get here: the ones who messed with the big kahunas, the one that like toons and the ones the rest of police think is unworthy to stay anywhere else.
> 
> All good fellow, let made it clear.
> 
> Job here is very tranquil, as long you adapt yourself with all the toon zaniness: we'll take you for a Toon Logic training camp in some days. Don't understate this thing, because of those two reasons:
>  
> 1. Toon's minds doesn't work always like ours, so it's good to understand how a toon's mind works. This will help you to understand how they behave and how this change how to interpret laws;
> 1. Your life can be saved by understand Toon Logic, like I said before. There'll always a crazy toon thug that will take more machine guns from his pants pockets than the entire Navy. When this happens, no matter how good is your bulletproof vest, maybe a good Portable Hole or a Pen to draw a wall in front of you would be a better idea.
> 
> Looks like you understand, nah, son? Everything's right? Gun? Radio? Badge? Ears? Alright. Let's go patrol and I'll talk a little more about all people here.
> 
> Toontown was a property of one of the cartoon _biog kahunas_, before became a Los Angeles Neighborhood. I think you know that Toons, or _Squama Sapiens_ if you like the science posh, lives for some time between us... I think our grandparents' grandparents were the last ones to have a society without Toons. There were few of them at first, but now I think 10, 15% of all L.A. population are Toons: I think that there's more Toons here than anywhere in the world, although the Japs talks about that _Animegaoka_ place, that was reconstructed after we carpet-bombed Tokyo.
>
> But I digress. Back to the topic: when the said _big kahuna_ kicked the bucket, he left a Will giving Toontown to the Toons. No one knows how the guy took the land's deed to begin, but the fact was that Toontown was given to the Toons. There was a lot of mess on the thing, until that, 5 years ago, **_Los Angeles_ vs _Toons_** decided that Toontown would be treated as a Neighborhood, with councillors, police district, all the package.
> 
> Tip: avoid the banana peels. You will not wall with stars rounding around you because a goddamn banana peel. Let us take a brake at Coco's: they have the best coffee and donuts here. On my own.
> 
> Now, I can see you're thinking: how can I catch the bandits, if they don't die and can just go against physics, evading prison and escaping from locks like there was nothing?
> 
> And this bring us back to Toon Logic: you need to understand, son, that half that happens here can't be understood by what we call _Logic_, _capiche_? OK, those donuts are as good as any other. But now, give a look in that two. Yeah, the cat and the mouse. Just get them, they are okay. _I know_, the mouse took a pan from God-only-knows and hit it straight against the cat, making the pan takes the cat face shape. Just another day here: the cat will be okay soon.
> 
> For a 101, two things you need to understand about a Toon mind:
> 
> 1. Toons ___CAN'T BE KILLED___, at least not by common was: take one of then, go to Bikini Atoll, put him on on of those bomb test silos, drop the H-bomb on the silo. It's more likely THE ATOLL goes into atoms then him. He would not be irradiated too... There's some was to kill a Toon once and for all, but _Toon Acceptance and Protection Act_ (TAPA) declared that only the Government, under VERY SPECIFIC circumstances, can kill a Toon for sure.
> 1. Toons ___ARE ALWAYS FUNNY___, or at least do their best to be: even the most serious of your Toony partners will use things like Portable Holes, Singing Swords, Bombs, Anvils and the oldy-goldy goddamn Banana Peels to uphold the law against the local riff-raff. But don't think that the riff-raff will stay on this: they have some goddamn pistols that hurts a goddamn lot. My shoulder still remembers one of those goddamn things: it was on my first day, and the others were no more experienced than me to be fair.
>
> _"How to stop them, so?"_ you are thinking. If you're thinking so, you do at least the right questions. This is the difference between life and death here, at least for us humans.
> 
> Let's go: you can't kill a Toon, this is fact. But this doesn't mean you can't _kill_ it, at least for a while. A Toon that get nuggets enough in the nuts Falls Down, in fact, go into a weird silly stance, that would be the more dead-like state he can go. Sure, you can't make him _stays dead_, but this is the time we have to restrain them with some _Toon-proof_ made equipment we developed recently. Look on you belt: the handcuffs looks a little glossy, right? Like it was made itself on Toon Ink. In fact, I'll talk about this soon.
> 
> Another thing: do you remember when I said Toons needs to be Funny? So, this is one of the way to catch those shenanigans, by use their logic against themselves, making them feel they could get into a good joke or pun. That's the way to take them.
> 
> All those circus classes will not be in vain, _capiche_? Okay, let see... Can you see that rascal at the top of that building? Looks he's trying something nasty, right? Let us try the oldy-goldy _Shave and Haircut..._
> 
> Yeah, he fell like a duck, right? Let catch this guy and put him of Fastii to bring him to the District.
> 
> Looks like you already understood the ears thing, the _"little gift"_ that came with the uniform for the Toontown PD. This is _Sargent Stout_ thing: he was a clown in The Biggest Show on Earth, before being drafted to the European Front and get back, into a Toon craziness. When he found about the Toontown PD, he got into the Academy and joined the Police. He's a billiard-bald, baby-face, nasal-speaker midget that made you too found to give him some good blows, but need to say: you'll never want to cross _Pinky_... Ooops... the _Sargent Pericles Adamastor Stout_. He's really competent and know how to walk the walk and talk the talk. Otherwise he would be already dead or, worse, booted.
> 
> He like to say that this little gift helps us human to get and mingle and understand how Toons thinks: he doesn't like the idea of human-only or toon-only partners. Today is an uncommon day, as it's your first day here. Toons are good, but each one has a weird, zany thing. They are toons, for God's sake! You'll deal with this or you'll quit.
> 
> This is our only car in the District _and_ our Stunt Driver for chasing. Sammy... Or better... _Officer Samantha Fastii_ here is as green on the job as you. He joined the police after being catched as speedster on the Tutti-Frutti Peaks. Took some time on parole with us at the District and liked the job. We had to give back our normal police car to Central, because Fastii in fact is all we need... However, maybe you should bring an anti-sickness tonic with you if you get with her: there's _dragster_ cars that are slower than her.
> 
> Ah... Back to base. Batter now? Sammy should be nice with you, it's your first day. I think she just wanted to play a prank with you. Here: nice black coffee, sweeten with _Queen Bee_'s honey and sugar. The Healing Salve _Officer Manny Lindberg_ ready for us. She came from District to District until she came here... God bless her, she's not good in the field, but need to say: she makes everything here run clean and proper, and the food she does is heavenly. We could say she's everyone in the District's mommy.
>
> Thinking why _Detective Matthew McCormick_ is giving the evil eye against you? It's the ears. Don't worry: he doesn't like anyone here anyway, and like to make this clear all the time, that he was pushed here against his own. He's competent and all, but we could say he's Pinky Evil Twin: serious and non-nonsense, just didn't died yet here because he can, for some reason, call a kind of _Cold Logic_ that allows him to deny any use of _Toon Logic_. Need to say, he's creepy as hell: I don't know what the hell he did against the Corporation big guys, but it was something big to be send here. And here's a tip: never, EVER call him Matty. Only Pinky can be do that without being punched straight in the face.
> 
> Those are the best toon partners you may want: remember I said you about an _Officer Mousekewitz_? Well: this is _Andraas Mousekewitz_. He's a short guy, but if you need someone to cover you with Toon Logic, he's the guy. The mousey is also very smart. And the eagle there in the perch is _Officer Till Lasker_: he works looking over for thugs over the sky, as scout. He's incredible when flying, but in the ground he walks like a chicken pecking all around... No offenses, Lasker.
> 
> _Eddy Gorilla_ is the District beat cop: he was a bouncer, one of the toughest ones, until some four years ago he joined the police and is looking for a career. He isn't the bright apple in the basket, but he's a hard worker and wants to take the Detective post here in the District. Matty help him: it's a open secret that he wants to get out, and he thinks that, if Eddy became the District Detective, we could get back to Central, as he would be "wasted" here. Well, if this is the plan, _"Vaya con dios"_, as Panchito could say.
> 
> These two are a pair that got together because the after-time artistic hobbies: _Officers Terrance Jones_ e _Sally McClown_. _Terry_ and _Silly Sally_ likes arts a lot, and when off duty, hey can be seen acting in the local Vaudeville Theater. _Terry_ play the sax and is a top-notch jazzist, his _bebop_ flowing like wine in the theater. And he's very good on the job: some says that he was sent here for real because he's of color. Well, better to us: we need guys like him.
> 
> Sally, however, is not as funny as she think she is, but is silly enough to warm the heart of the kids. She has also that kind of big motherly heart: any problem off duty you want to talk about, she has a free shoulder to put your head. If you need so, she even allows you to squeeze a little her squeaking clowny nose. Some says this helps a lot.
>
> Those two came from bad backgrounds, _Officers Jimmy Cho_ and _Alvin McDaggert_. Alvin was sent here on "overzealoness": to be fair, he is not against punch bad guys out to their senses. He has a short fuse. Jimmy, by his time, had some problem when his brother was arrested involved in the Triad gangs wars. Jimmy was splashed by the "bad blood", so to speak, and was transferred to ToonTown. Don't take things wrong, though, they are good chaps. Just avoid to mess with them on their blind spot, this would be a big problem.
> 
> _Officer Tobin O'Shea_, nicknamed _Toby_, is from Irish descendancy, and is a good chap. A weird thing is, he is a scoundrel somewhat: looks like his father worked doing and selling booze the Prohibition. Nowadays, however, his family is as respectable as anyone else's.
> 
> And that one is our coroner and forensics specialist, Connor McRabbit. Yeah, he looks like a distant relative from _Alice In Wonderland_'s _White Rabbit_, but he never is late on anything... Between us: when he does autopsies, see those bleach white paws tainted in Blood Red or Ink Black can give anyone the willies.
>
> And as we are talking about Ink, there's two important things you need to know about Toon Ink. First, everyone and everything Toon is made of Ink: Ink is for Toons what Blood and Bone are for us humans, but more, in fact, because _**EVERYTHING**_ is made of Ink. There's some ways to manipulate Ink into some weird useful ways using Ink. And this is why you have a Pencil and Pen aside your gun holster. Believe me: this is more useful you can imagine.
> 
> Second, and very important: Toon Ink can somewhat contaminate. Easy, son, don't worry with the McCow's donuts: even done with Ink, like everything here, they are as nutritious as "normal" food. You just need to be cautious when calling the Toon Logic upon: here, it's possible to use some of the same "powers" Toons have, healing wounds and so, but this happens because, in fact, the Ink start to replace Blood and Bone.
> 
> Scared? Don't worry, son: someone needs to do this kind of thing for years and years until they could go any Toonish, as soon the scientists had discovered. There's the example: old gold _Cody O'Mara_ here. He was the only police officer in Toontown until they came with the district, so he's the oldest officer here. As he needed to use the Toon Logic a lot to avoid being hurt by the thugs here, now he's starting to get into a Toon Rabbit: his legs are now big haunches and there's two big floppy rabbit ears over his head. He's a good chap, as his dogs, if you like a tornado mass of cuddly cute destruction... But if you have some baseballs, they go nice and smooth playing fetch.
>
> Now you understood where you are, right? By your eyes, you're liking. The Rabbit Ears doesn't look that silly anymore, right? We are all mad here, but the secret is, all the best people are.
> 
> Welcome to 1st ToonTown PD, son. I think you'll enjoy the job.

## The 1st ToonTown PD's History

### About ToonTown

Nearby Hollywood and their great cinema studios, if you go through a tunnel on a certain mount, you'll get into one of the newest Los Angeles' neighborhoods. Until some years ago a property of one of the biggest cartoon films moguls, became property of the cartoons that lived there after the mogul's demise, under his will.

Toontown is a ___big, weird, neighborhood___, specially because its bright colors and their population: almost all the known _Cartoons_, Toons to short, live or are linked somehow with ToonTown.

However, even between them there's those who wants to impose their will or that believe that what they can't control is dangerous and evil. This brought some dissent and conflict involving Toons, including the ___Moral Right-Wing Crusade that fight against Toons___. However, a recent decision on the court involving the Toons and Los Angeles City Council determined that Toons would be considered full-fledged American Citizens, ToonTown being their home, becoming a neighborhood under Los Angeles City.

### Crime at ToonTown

However, as in any place, there was crime in ToonTown, as shown by the circumstances involving the mogul owner of ToonTown and its aftermath.

Obviously, crime still prospered, even more now that humans went into ToonTown to go tourist. Sure, the majority of the Toons tried to live honest, legitimate lives, working as guides to show all the tourist spots at ToonTown (and maybe feel on their own skin part of the Toon life, into funny ways).

However, there was some cruel criminals, Toons that even the Prohibition (or before) cashed big money and power through shady business, including theft, pimping, smuggling and even murder: after all, a piano straight your his head couldn't be funny if you're not a Toon.

### The ToonTown PD

It was when, in the _Los Angeles vs Toons_ aftermath, ToonTown became a L.A. neighborhood. With this, Toons had the same rights and duties as all others L.A. inhabitants.

With this, public security needed to be enforced, for humans and Toon's own good. And the 1st ToonTown Police District was set up.

The District is still very small, either on infrastructure as in personnel: basically the personnel is made by some officers, both Toon and human; by Detective Matthew "Matty" McCormick, that says he's there against his will; by the Commander, Sargent Pericles Adamastor "Pinky" Stout; and district's attendant and clerk, Officer Manny Lindberg. Some says (and Matty reinforces this idea) that the ToonTown PD is the rock bottom on L.A. Police' Career, albeit some officers, like the Sargent "Pinky" Stout, got into it by their own will.

ToonTown PD's building is a very colorful one, made as a Cartoon one, like those old-fashioned PDs from old time cartoons. Officer Lindberg, the PD's attendant, normally is on the reception. There's few individuals rooms, like the ones for Matty and Pinky, although the later (that lots of Toons just call "Sarge") normally do the patrol with some of the officers. The officers shares a living room, and this includes Officer Samantha Fastii (that gets in and out the building by the garage). There's also a small jail, where normally there's some toons locked in by drunkenness, vagrancy or by connections with Mafia (some thinks this is really funny, go figure).

The PD creation is circled with mystery: some says that the District is part of a right-wing moral agenda to put the toons "on their own place", some toons believing that's there some secret Agenda from L.A. Police against them. However, until now, the PD work and Pinky understanding on Toon's mind-frame had made everything goes smooth and the Toons growing into the idea that the PD is a good thing for everyone... As long Pinky is the boss there.

### ToonTown's Places and Faces

#### ___The Crazy Dodo___ - The ToonTown's Burlesque Club

The ___Crazy Dodo___ is one of the most famous clubs in ToonTown. Built in the Prohibition, the Crazy Dodo was the main ToonTown speakeasy at that time, as even some Toons were crazy for some spirits. The deceased ToonTown owner was somewhat relapse with the Booze smuggling to and from ToonTown, and this made even some humans to go into ToonTown for some drink. When the Prohibition got over, lots of ToonTown's speakeasies fade away into oblivion, or became meeting points for the worst in the worst of the riffraff and demimondaine at ToonTown.

_Crazy Dodo_, however, rebuilt himself as a place where people could take some drinks, snacks, maybe some adult fun. In fact, there's some nights at _Crazy Dodo_ focused on the Burlesque, but its owner, ___Susan "Foxxy" Fox___, made it very clear that into the _Dodo_ everything runs smooth and under a civil, educated, right level (outside the _Dodo_ things could change)

The _Dodo_ opens at 6pm and closes when the last consumer got out, normally 4am more or less. Drinks are not expensive, if you put the quality of them under account. This quality is most thanks to ___Jacques Le Chat___, the current toon cat bartender and _sommelier_, that knows how to do all kind of drinks, with more or less alcohol by client request, from the almost zero alcohol to those that could put even a rhino down. _Dodo_'s crew are made by Le Chat, some waiters and some house toon artists, like the singer ___Jeanne "Wooly" Woolima___ and the vaudeville actor ___Craig "Kiddy" McBaalian___.

The _Dodo_ is basically a meeting point, one of that ___Elysiums___ so beloved by detectives, places where you don't need the fists or the guns to solve problems (at least not on a common basis), This calm feeling is enforced by Foxxy under all means, with the help of her bouncers, Max and Spike. They are not against to punch some common sense on someone and, even being not the smart apples in the basket, is not something that someone that like his own skin (or pelt, or scales, or feathers, or whatever), at least if they like it where it is.

#### The "secret" lab of the Mad Doktor Helmut Von Latzen

Helmut Von Latzen, ToonTown's resident Mad Scientist, is ___all but secret___: ___it is listed on the ToonTown Tourist Guide___. The most curious thing on it is that there's a big plaque on the walls that circle the big _"secret"_ castle, that can be seen in the edge of one of Tutti-Frutti Peak's abyss: _"Doktor Von Latzen's Secret Base. Entrance not Allowed. Trespassers will be shot. Monitored visits on Thursdays, Saturdays."_

The Base looks like a "vanilla" Toon  Mad Scientist's one: a scary castle, fringing on the edge of an abyss, thunder and lighting blasting all around, crooked scary trees in the road from the doorway to the castle, owls all around. Inside things are not that better: thunder, lightnings, Jacob Ladders, big copper Knife Switches and so on, as on those lousy old Frankenstein movie... Hysterical screams could be heard all around the corridors while they crossed it chaperoned by Von Latzen's own lackey, Hugo (_"Igor_ ist _so 1920s."_, Von Latzen says), that looks like a meat-made (or better, Ink-made) cousin of Woody Woodpecker's Frankie, the chicken-plucker. And, to be fair, isn't smarter than the later.

Helmut Von Latzen (_"Herr Doktor"_ he would stress being called), is a Human-drawn Toon. He looks really mad normally, when doing his science experiments, but when talking he is a very normal guy, even when talking about his recent research on how to create assassin zombies (in fact, more like birthday party jugglers zombies that uses chainsaw on their juggling than _real_ assassin zombies) or any other funnily insane thing he is involved on it.

He's clean under the law, and even putting into account his insane looks and behavior and everything, he's one of the most cherished citizens in ToonTown, as they believe that all  respectable Toon neighborhood needs their own mad scientist...

Go figure.

#### The No Good Alley

The No-Good Alley is ToonTown outskirts, where the poorest Toons lives, and crime grows prosper. A region disputed by Toon gangs, it's a dangerous place by anyone to cross around, no matter you're a Toon or a human. Even Toons avoid the No-Good alley as there was no tomorrow, as there's lots of thieves and assassins. Those are violent and sadists even for Toon's standards and are proficient into the so-called _Fall Down Crimes_: they make the victim (Toon or Human) Fall Down and then, while they are helpless remaking themselves, they do what they want with the victim.

ToonTown Mafia, commanded by _Don Rinozzo_, a very impressive Toon, either on his size and weight and education and ruthlessness and efficiency while doing his shady businesses, is trying to take the No-Good Alley by himself, to make it more adequate for their own businesses, but he suffers with the resistance of _Langley O'Toole_, a crazy Irish descendant Fox Toon, that has no fear or scruples when reinforce what he thinks is his territory.

#### Bedlam Asylum for the Mentally Disable

Popularly called "Bedlam Madhouse", this is ___one of the most avoided place for everyone that lives in ToonTown___: even the most hard-boiled Toons avoid the Asylum, as it's said that ___there lives really insane toons, even for their own standards___, what means that they are TOTALLY, UTHERLY BONKERS!!!! No matter how tough someone is, the lights and screams and mad laughs that came from Bedlam can make even the biggest guys cringe, some even meekly asking for Mommy.

There's some gossip about a human, previously owner of a Toon movies business was admitted at Bedlam, after trying to kill himself trying to cross the US coast-to-coast through the air, getting from the Empire State at New York to Los Angeles, trying to using the so-called Illogical Logic by walking in the air. No one how much is gossip and how much is true on this thing, and very few are bold enough to get into the Asylum, managed by _Doctor Austena_, a Fox Toon Doctor that do his best for his interns.

## The Rules

Human characters at 1° ToonTown PD are build by the same rules at _Fate Accelerated Edition_ (FAE). The rules here deal on how to create Toon characters and some rules about the _Toon Logic_, his use and how even human characters can use them.


### Creating a Toon

A Toon is created by the same rules on FAE, but using a new Approach set:

- ___Acumen:___ works as by _Clever_ - used when Toons tries to solve things by intelligence or cleverness, like avoiding misread a sign or track the gorilla that is straying around the city to bring it back to zoo;
- ___Flippancy:___ works as by _Quick_ - used when Toons do things using dexterity, agility and speed, like avoiding the steamroller that is going against you.
- ___Swindle:___ works as by _Sneaky_ - used when Toons do sneaky, shoddy things, like try to convince the dog to jump into the abyss or try to pass some shoddy explosives for the coyote, that will explode on his face.
- ___Vigor:___ works as by _Forceful_ - used when Toons do things using sheer strength and violence, like bring doors down and the all-time favorite brick throwing;

As there's a reduced number of Approaches, Toons have _1 Good (+3), 1 Fair (+2)_ and _2 Average (+1)_ Toon Approaches.

### The Rule of Fun

All Toons needs to be funny. In fact, lots of their actions are not dictated by logic, but by the zaniness and fun. In rule terms, you can consider that all Toon settings has an Aspect that say that a Toon character actions ___needs to be funny and zany, not necessarily logical or sensible___ (this is an ___Scenario Aspect___). This explain why Toons has no equivalent Approaches for _Careful_ and _Flashy_, and they normally will fail on them. As a ___Superstar Rule___ (optional rule), the GM can use _Flippancy_ as alternative for _Flashy_ and _Acumen_ as alternative for _Careful_.

To emulate this zaniness and fun while dealing with Toon, some FAE rules works a little differently when dealing with Toons.

#### Funny Invocations, Compels and _Breaking the Fourth Wall_

A Toon can Invoke and Compel his Aspects normally, not just when it's fun for the character, but also when it is _for the players_, as the Toon was able to ___Break the Fourth Wall___. If the GM allows, every funny enough Aspect Invoke has no cost: think that, as a Toon ___Always have to be funny___, a funny invoke can be translated as an invoke AND as a compel by the previously shown Scenario Aspect. A Funny Compel also can result into 2 Fate Points (4 into a Double Compel) if, after being accepts, the character do it into some funny way. However, avoid a Funny Compel can cost the same 2 or 4 Fate Points.

> ___Example:___ Mackie the Mouse has the Aspect ___A Scaredy Cat... Ops... Mouse___ when he saw Gorillaconda. Mackie's player says: _"Alright... As Mackie is __A Scaredy Cat... Ops... Mouse__, I'll __Break the Fourth Wall__ and compel this Aspect: he melt into a big puddle of a weird colored goo with two eyes and slither away from Gorillaconda as fast as he can!"_ The GM thinks this is really funny, as the other players do, so this compel result into a 2-FPs Funny Compel for Mackie.

#### One-Shot Stunts

Toons are known because they can do all kind of weird crazy funny thing all the time. To deal with this there's the _One-Shot Stunt_ rule: if a character wants to create an effect that could be emulated by a ___be fantastic into something___ Stunt but doesn't have it, the player can ask the GM to use it as a _One-Shot Stunt_. If the GM allows, the player pays 1 FP (or 2 for one really powerful Stunt at GM discretion) and can use this Stunt during one scene (if the Stunt by itself demands a Fate Point, this is paid aside the One-Shot Stunt FP). This is specially useful to use Stunts that emulate Toon Logic.

> ___Example:___ Carl, Mackie The Mouse's player, really wants to deal with Drowsy Cat, played by Lorraine, that is messing with this nephew, Baby Louie. Mackie has no good enough Stunt, but he remember that Count Von Squash, Silvia's were-duck, has the ___Jekyll and Hyde___ Stunts, that sounds like a good one for an _One-Shot_. So, Carl go for the GM and asks if he can take this as an _One-Shot_, so Mackie turns into a Mackiezilla to wallop the Drowsy Cat. The GM thinks that the things will grow really funny and go green for this _One-Shot Stunt_. After paying the PD, Carl describes how Mackie looks the blistering red bottom of Louie after the Drowsy Cat hit him in with the tawsy. And Mackie goes mad, growing and growing, a drooling monster screaming and punching his chest like King Kong. With his, during this conflict, he receives +2 on all his Attacks based on Vigor.

### Toon Logic and Illogical Logic

The Cartoon physics are not like normal. It is... Well... ___Toony___. To emulate this, we'll describe the two main kinds of Toon Logic

#### Toon Logic

___Toon Logic___ is when Toons tries to do things into a conscious, funny way. Normally a Toon just need to do a _Create Advantage_ roll with _Swindle_ to do this, or expend a Fate Point (or not, if the can ___Break the Fourth Wall___ in the process)

> ___Example:___ Mackie wants to go to Japan but has no money for the plane ticket, so he have an idea: he take an envelope, write on it __Tokyo, Japan__ and starts to squeeze himself into it until people can just see his hand out, putting the stamps on it and throwing the mail into the mailbox. No character could do this normally, as physics doesn't allow. However, as a Toon, Mackie can use _Toon Logic_ to do this trick. For this, he needs to roll successfully against _Swindle_ to use Toon _Logic_.

#### Illogical Logic 

___Illogical Logic___, on the other side, is when a Toon ___unconsciously___ uses Toon Logic to avoid a kind of setback. The example is the classic coyote scene that somehow cross the hill: he do this because ___he's too dumb___ and doesn't remember about gravity. In this case, the GM rolls (preferably on secret) against _Acumen_. If the roll is a ___Fail___ the character is ___successful___, as he was not enough to remember about the setback. However, if the roll was ___successful___, he remembers about the gravity and...

#### Superstar Rules: Illogical Logic and Breaking the Fourth Wall 

- A Toon can declare that will _intentionally_ fail on a _Illogical Logic_ check, ___Breaking the Fourth Wall___ and caching 2 FPs on this (as a Toon)
- Other Toons can ___Break the Fourth Wall___ against a _successful_ use of the _Illogical Logic_. For this, they need to pay a Fate Point, that goes for the subject as part of the FPs paid by the ___Breaking of the Fourth Wall___.

> ___Example:___ Rory Coyote failed his Acumen roll to not fall down into the abyss after goes away from the road while using some rocket powered skates that are fumbling (ACME Products). Larissa, Geena Kiwi's player, decide that she wants to see Rory under a bad situation after everything he did with Gina, and that spent a Fate Point for this is fair. She choose to ___Break the Fourth Wall___. While Rory goes near the other side of the abyss, Geena looks for him and gives a wink... Rory stops in the air, look down, pass his hand below the skates and....
>
> ___AAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeee .... thud...___

### Boggled!!!!

A character gets ___Boggled!!!___ he suffer an Attack during a Conflict that is _Successful with a Style_ (specially if the character in question is a Toon). ___Boggling!!!___ is a Mild Consequence that can be cleaned at the end of the Conflict/Scene. A character can suffer more than one single __*Boggled!!!*__, and clean all of them at the same time.

> ___Example:___ Rory Coyote, Kelly's character, is craving for a stew made with Geena Kiwi, Larissa's character, and try to catch her. However, Geena Kiwi just pass through his legs in an almost-supersonic speed, a _Success with a Style_ in the _Flippancy_ roll for Geena, and give him a ___Boggled!!!!___ Consequence, making Rory rolling into his own hips like a weird carpet because the vacuum that Geena made.

As a ___Superstar Rule___, when a toon describes the result of a ___Boggled!___ Consequence, or opt to take one as part of the results of actions happened in the scene, _and_ do this  funnily enough (GM and other players' discretion), the GM can treat this as a ___Fourth Wall Breaking___


> ___Example:___ Mackie the Mouse became a _Mackiezilla_ after the Drowsy Cat really maltreated his nephew. Josh, Drowsy Cat's player, looks for the situation and says: _"Uh oh, looks like the Drowsy Cat is in real trouble now! Look, as Mackie became a Mackiezilla and grew a lot bigger than the Drowsy Cat, he starts to shrink, going even smaller then Baby Louie, until he got the size of a flea, and then he gave a scared squeak and try to run away from Mackiezilla!"_
> 
> Everyone look each other and to the GM, making clear that this was fun enough to be considered a __*Fourth Wall Break*__ while the Drowsy Cat gets __*Boggled!!!*__, even this allowing the Drowsy Cat to be squashed like a pulp as the flea he is by Mackiezilla. So, Josh is award the FP by the GM

### Fall Down

Fall Downs happens when a Toon is _Taken Down_ under certain really funny circumstances. A player has the option on, when _Falling Down_, pay an FP and reduce all his Consequences under a level, but he was still _Taken Down_, and so out of the conflict. GM words is final on what makes a Fall Down or not. If Mackie the Mouse just slaps the Drowsy Cat's face, even if this is strong enough to make him Fall Down, it's not enough to be looked as a Fall Down. However, if Dora McPhee uses her ___38th Judo Dan___ to wallop Big Chimp, throw him against a nearby wall making him go flat as a pancake... This is a Fall Down for sure!

> ___Example:___ Sylvester Skunk is investigating the docks where Big Chimp works as part of Don Cabezone's Mafia, and engages into a fight against the Big Chimp. While the are fighting, Sylvester chooses to use his skunk aroma against Big Chimp. He does this and Big Chimp can't cope the powerful stink, that make him breaks like a crystal goblet, Falling Down. The GM, as Big Chimp, chooses to pay a FP to reduces all the Consequences the Big Chimp suffered, readying him for the next conflicts, but anyway, Big Chimp was taken down, while Sylvester sweeps the stinky Big Chimp shards to a garbage bin nearby.

As a ___Superstar Rule___, if a player _give in_, he can turn this into a Fall Down if both sides agree on the terms. If the result is funny enough (GM and other players' discretion), both sides can cache some benefits on this: the character that _gave in_ receive 2 FPs in the end of the conflict, while the victorious side doesn't need to pay the FP it would normally does. You know: this came from the cartoon show budget (AKA the GM). The character that _gave in_ also receive FPs based on Consequences he received and also can use 1 FP to low all his Consequences into one level.

> ___Example:___ Mackie the Mouse, now Mackiezilla, is looking to squash the flea-sized Drowsy Cat to a pulp, when Dora McPhee looks to him and say _"You will not do anything against this little kitty, you hoodlum!"_, and says that will use her ___38th Judo Dan___  against Mackie. Carl, Mackie's player, thinks that going into a fight against Dora will just result into a _Take Down_, so he choose to _Give In_ for Dora, looking to turn this into a _Fall Down_, with less trouble and some FPs he can cache in the process. Anna, Dora's player, asks Carl how this will happens, and he says: _"Alright... Let's Go... When Mackiezilla is almost squashing  Drowsy Cat like a cockroach, Dora takes the now giant little finger from Mackiezilla foot and lifting him in the air, throwing him to the ground, from a side to the other, from a side to the other... And again... And again... and then she throws him against the wall, that stretch like the corners of a WWE ring throwing him back to Dora, that takes him in the air and finishes him with a German Suplex, leaving the now back to his normal size Mackie the Mouse into the ground, totally walloped with some small stars circling his head."_ Anna smiles thinking on the fun, and agrees. Everyone else also thinks this is funny enough to be taken as a Fall Down, so Mackie receives 2 FP without any cost for Dora.

### Clearing Stress and Consequences

A Toon can use 1 FP to clear all the Stress suffered ___or___ reduce all the Consequences he have into a level, BUT:

1. He can do this just once per conflict;
2. He needs to choose this before spend the FP
3. He can do this if, ___and only if___, he do into a funny way (GM discretion, and not a common thing)
4. He can't clear Extreme Consequences this way (if you're using this rule)

> ***Example:*** Rory Coyote is lifting from the ground after falling from a hill (again) and see that Boris Dogorowitz really wants to wallop him, so he choose to clear the Stress and Consequences he have. He put a bicycle pump into his mouth and starts to pump like he was trying to blow a balloon. The GM thinks this is really funny, and this can also extend a good fun conflict, so allow Rory to clear Stress or Consequences. He chose, as Dogorowitz had walloped lots of Consequences on him (he's just a tad to be Taken Down), he opts to reduces his consequences. He pays the FP and all his consequences got down a level.

## Powers, Equipments, Special Effects

As by all FAE characters, a Toon can take a certain number of common items, or at least items that could be explained to the GM, and he can have how many of them they wants/needs. If Mackie the Mouse wants a screwdriver, he can have it: heck, he can have how many of them he wants. However, the GM have final word on what a common item is or not: if Doktor Von Kuak wants a Lab-In-a-Bag, he can. But if Roy Rocket would try the same thing, normally he could not, even he having a NASCAR sports car that Von Kuak would not have.

However, certain Equipments and Powers are so uncommon that even Toons needs to pay for them. All of them are treated as Stunts (or Aspects), and many of them can also be used as One-Shot Stunts (as above)

### Bag of Many Things
 
With this item, at 1 FP, you can take any item you need. ANY. ITEM. Banana Split? Here! Bazooka! In the hand! Super Martian Rocket UFO? Well, you won one into a ballot some days ago! Some Toons have bags, pockets, belts or other things  from them they can take almost anything, from a banana to a ICBM.

A Toon with this Stunt can, under GM's discretion and paying 1 FP, take from the Bag any item he wants. The GM can disallow the PCs to take from the Bag any item that can works as a instant solution for the story (like the _Love's Potion_ the _Wicked Witch_ needs to become pretty), but otherwise everything is fair game.

This item works even better as an Aspect, because the GM can Compel it to make the Bag go amok and throw all kind of silly funny item.

### Coat of Arms

The character have a Coat that has some mechanical or magical arms that works "independently" and allows him to do more than an action without penalties. The player pays a FP to do as much non-Defense actions than Stunts he put on this (Defense Actions are still free, and any action not used is wasted)

> ___Example:___ As an Octopus, Orla Octopovna bought Coat Of Arms three times. So, she can do as up as three non-Defense actions paying 1 FP without penalties.

As by the Bag of Many Things, taking _Coat of Arms_ as an Aspect turns things even more interesting: on the plus size, the Coat is now an Extra that allows 2 extra Actions per Stunt invested on it. However, the GM can Compel this Aspect to make the Coat go amok and works against the character's will. And worst, the GM can pay 1 FP to receive the same 2 Actions per Stunt the player have.

### Hair Remover

When used by someone (drinking, for example) make the character _Fall Down!_ with a  ___Bald Head___ Mild Consequence.

### Hair Restorer

When used by someone (drinking, for example) make the character _Fall Down!_ with a  ___Mega Hair___ Mild Consequence. Can be used to counter _Hair Remover_ and vice-versa

### Hare Restorer

A powerful tonic to be used by Rabbits and Hare restores all their health. Drink it allows the rabbit to clean his worst Consequences ___or___ all the Stress suffered until the moment (ONLY ONE OF IT). A Hare Restorer can be used only once by scene.

However, if a non-rabbit character drinks this tonic, he'll transform instantly on a rabbit (or maybe not... Maybe this is the chance for a funny were-rabbit transformation), with a adequate _Moderate Consequence_, as in ___Carrot Craziness___, __"What's up, Doc?"__ or something funnily appropriated (GM discretion), until he _Falls Down_ (note you need to _Fall Down_ - just being _Taken Down_ is not enough!)

A non-rabbit character that _voluntarily_ accept to take a Hare Restore is enlisted to receive a FP as by ___Breaking the Fourth Wall___, specially if searching and/or confounding it by a Hair Restorer. 

A Hare Restorer works in humans too, with the same Consequences for the human that would suffer a non-rabbit toon. If you're using the Superstar rules for Toonification, it can count as an action that can results into toonification. If its the reason for the first toonification consequence, the human will become some rabbit or hare toon.

### Hare Remover

A powerful anti-Rabbit or Hare venom, the Hare Remover make Rabbits and Hares Fall Down _INSTANTLY!!!_ if they drank it, without earning a Fate Point for this (except if the rabbit take it _voluntarily_, as if he ___breaks the Fourth Wall___). Characters can identifies the Hare Remover by an _Acumen_ check. 

A Hare Remover can be used as Hare Restorer antidote took by a non-Rabbit toon or an human. However, it ___doesn't___ remove the toonification consequences for humans.

### Portable Hole

A Portable Hole is basically a piece of weird material that can be placed into any plain place, creating a hole on it (albeit not always passing through them), and they are very useful.

A first use is to _Create Advantages_ with _Swindle_ with a +2. For example: _T. H. ief_, the great bandit, uses as Portable Hole to Create an Advantage while trying to open a safe where is the emerald he wants.

Another way is by using the Portable Hole by _Creating Advantages_ with _Acumen_. For example: Dora McPhee is an old woman that uses Portable Holes to avoid to walk too much to her Judo Dojo using Portable Holes, one at her house and other at the Dojo.

But the most powerful Portable Hole work also with ___Cosmic Shift___ (looks down) to do an _Attack_ with _Swindle_.

> ___Example:___ Rory Coyote is looking into the Portable Hole that (he doesn't know) Geena Kiwi put at the wall. He starts to hear a sound... With a light coming... While the sound goes higher... The lights turn even more brighter.... And...
>  
> BBBBBBBAAAAWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!
>  
> A FREAKING BIG TRAIN get out the Portable Hole, making him Fall Down, looking like a weird ladder.


### Incredible Strength/Speed/Senses/Whatever

This covers all those Super-strength/Speed/whatever. Using this, the Toon receive +2 on all his checks involving that sense, _once per session_, during a scene (GM Discretion). For more uses, maybe you choose take this as an Aspect.

### Detect Item

With this Stunt, the character receive +2 at any check to find that kind of item, even when not trying to find it actively, like he had a radar on this.

### Jekyll/Hyde Potion

This Potion (or item) can change the Character Aspects during an scene/conflict. When drinking the potion, the character will change his ___High Concept___ by some of the options below, under GM discretion:

+ A good toon will become a ___Crazy, Nasty, Violent (even for Toon's standards) Monster___. While under the potion's effect, the character receive +2 into _Vigor_ while trying to wallop everything in your way, and a -2 on all _Acumen_ rolls.
+ A bad toon, otherwise, will become a __*Nice, Adorable, Innocent, sickly goody two-shoes!*__, receive -2 on all _Vigor_ rolls and +2 on all _Acumen_ rolls while trying to peacefully solve problems.

A _Fall Down_ or a second dose of the potion will nullify all the effects, bringing the PC under his original situation, and the GM can put also extra effects for the potion.

If the character does anything that _voluntarily_ triggers this kind of effect, he can define a _"undo clause"_ to get back his original status. The caveat, however, is that this is under _GM_ discretion.

> ___Example:___ Mackie the Mouse see the Drowsy Cat messing AGAIN with Baby Louie. Carl, Mackie's player, say the GM: _"Alright, I'll be Mackiezilla again, but_ only _till I assure Baby Louie is safe!"_ The GM agrees, as he knows that, while Baby Louie is not safe, Mackiezilla will bring havoc to the scene, and this will be SO. FREAKING. COOL!

As by the _Hare Restorer/Remover_, an human can use _Jekyll/Hyde potion_, and the consequences for this are the same for a toon

### Teleport

With this Stunt, a PC can get anywhere in a radius of zones equal his _Swindle_ level without rolls, with a 1 FP. This, however, still counts as an action.

### Incredible Luck

This character is REALLY, REALLY LUCKY. Once per session, he can take the advantages of using a Fate Point without using it, as it was on hold.

### Change Shape

This character can change his shape at will. He can use this to get a +2 to _Create Advantages_ related to disguise with _Swindle_.

### Flight

You can fly using your _Flippancy_, after being successful on a _Swindle_ roll. A Fail results on the character falling down straight in the ground, suffering a 2-Stress Damage, that can be risen or lower at GM Discretion. The _Swindle_ roll isn't needed if the PC turns this Stunt is into an Extra by linking it with an Aspect

### Hypnotic Trance

Using this Stunt, the Toon can put others into an ___Hypnotic Trance___, with +2 while Creating Advantages with _Swindle_. In a Failure, however, it's the Toon itself that goes into an ___Hypnotic Trance___

### Independent Shadow

A character can make someone's shadow to turn into an independent character paying 1 FP and rolling _Swindle_ against the target's _Acumen_ (if the target is involuntary. Voluntary targets doesn't need the roll). The GM chooses the shadow Aspects, normally the same ones of the victim, beside one or two. The Shadow has it's own Stress Track and Consequences Slots.

Notice that the character being able to turn it's own shadow independent doesn't mean the shadow will be supportive for the character: it is a full-fledged character on its own, with Aspects and everything else, and so he can even go against the character!

### Signs

Signs are a good way to avoid (or create) problems. However, lots of toons are not smart enough to read them. Each Sign has a difficult to be read, to be checked with _Acumen_ as a Overcome action. However, if the toon read it wrongly, it can be ___Confused___ or ___Bamboozled___, until a Fall Down or some other effect removes this Aspect.

A toon can use Signs to confound other toons, using a _Create Advantage_ roll with _Swindle_, that can be Defended with _Acumen_.

This doesn't need a Stunt: any toon can be do this.

### Cosmic Shift

The most overpower Stunt ever, Cosmic Shift can be understood with that classic example where a cat saw a branch of a tree where the little tweet bird is, and the TREE fall down, the branch in the air like it was fixed to a post.

Cosmic Shift can be understood as a Fate Point frozen as an Stunt. However, Cosmic Shift can be used ___when, and ONLY WHEN, IT'S FUNNY!!!___ It's not funny to make the Drowsy Cat trip on a brick, but make a anvil, coming from God-Only-Knows, hit him straight in the head just when he was to shove you into his mouth, definitively IS!

### Pens/Pencils/Brushes

A character can use a Pen to _Create Advantage_  using _Swindle_ to add new elements in the scenario, drawing them. Note that this is considered a use of _Toon Logic_, with all the implications, including that any Toon can do this at will.

> ___Example:___ Sylvester Skunk is on a corner, when one of Don Cabezone's goons yells to him: _"Take your gun, pal. I never kill a man unarmed!"_ The fact is that he's unarmed, but Roger, his player, do a classic _Toon Logic_ use: taking his detective notebook, he scrawls a very rough gun and point it to the goon. The GM asks for a _Swindle_ roll for the _Create Advantage_ action, and Sylvester is successful, with gave him the _Gun_ as an Aspect with a Free Invoke

You can turn the pen use as an _Overcome_ action if you think a _Create Advantage_ one is overkill.

You can use a Pen use to remove Consequences provoked by Erasers, with a _Overcome_ roll with a difficult equal to the _Consequence_ level. As an option, you can "redraw" a target and exchange the Consequences Aspects with a _Create Advantage_ action

> ___Example:___ Sylvester Skunk catched Rolf McWolf, but the guy is being a pain in the ass, so Sylvester has the idea of, as he erased some of the Rolf's pieces, redraw Rolf as a ___Cute defenseless lamb___. The GM liked the idea and all that Sylvester needs to rewrite the ___No Tail___ Mild Consequence of Rolf to a ___Cute defenseless lamb___ is to roll a _Swindle_ check against _Fair (+2)_ difficulty

### Eraser/Thinner/etc...

Another classic toon move is to use an Eraser, Thinner or something like this to remove elements and even characters (YIKES!!!!!) from the scene.

When used against other characters, this is an _Attack_ with _Swindle_. When doing this, however, the attacker can make the damage go straight to the Consequences, paying a Fate Point.

> ___Example:___ Mackie the Mouse had enough with the Drowsy Cat, so he takes an Eraser and tries to erase as much of the Drowsy Cat he can while running from him. He is successful and makes a 3-Stress Damage. But Carl, Mackie's player, pays a Fate Point to make the damage go straight to Consequences. This way, he provokes a ___Two Halves of a Cat___ Moderate Consequence on the Drowsy Cat.

When removing elements, the character is _Overcoming_ with _Swindle_ with a difficult based on the number and complexity of elements to be removed (GM Discretion):

> ___Example:___ Rory Coyote is trying to catch Geena Kiwi (again), and they are running through a train bridge. She then roll as an _Overcome_ to Erase all the bridge to the cliff other side with her Eraser. The GM ask her for a _Swindle_ check with a _Fair (+2)_ difficult. She is successful and then she erases almost half of the bridge. Rory Coyote is using his train-car to pass through the bridge and didn't noticed the absence of the rail and the bridge. However, he fails on his _Illogical Logic_ check by being successful on his _Acumen_ roll. When he was just ready to put his hand into Geena, she looks for him and gives a wink... Rory stops in the air, look down and....
> 
> ___AAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeee .... thud...___

## Real Humans in Toony adventures:

There's two "kinds" of human beings into Fate of Saturday Comics: human toons, that follows the same rules above, and real humans (think on Eddie Valiant on _Who Framed Roger Rabbit?_)

Real humans follows the default Fate Accelerated rules (or Fate Core ones) for character creation. They normally can't do any kind of Toon tricks, including ___Toon Logic___ or ___Illogical Logic___.

However, anytime a Real Human is on a ___Toon Area___ (like Toontown), he can Invoke the ___Toon Area___ Aspect to use any Toon tricks. If the scenario/campaign has lots of Human-Toons interactions, a character can take a Stunt to avoid this Fate Point spending if he can explain how.

> ___Example:___ Sargent Pericles "Pinky" Stout is chasing some of Don Rinozzo, ToonTown's Capo, goons. He could run or shoot against them, of course, but it would be a _gauche_ waste of energy, putting the goons speed into account. He then choose to use the fact that ___Toontown is a Toon Area___ to use ___Toon Logic___ and invokes some of his little friends, Officer O'Mara's pet dogs... He uses a Fate Point for that, and just when the goons thought they would run away they are KNOCKED DOWN by a D-Day sized horde of cute, playful puppies!

Humans can suffer stress normally from any weapon a toon use against him, and they can be killed by toons, specially when they are hit by heavy things, like a piano or a anvil straight in the head. No matter what, however, a human can't _Fall Down_.

A Human can, using a FP, negate a Toon trick like the ones shown above: for example, he can turn a ___Portable Hole___ into a hole drawn in a wall. The FP is used to negate the ___Toon Area___ Aspect and it goes for GM.

It's important to note that Humans ___can___ suffer the effects of items or actions related with Toon Logic: if a human drinks a _Hare Restorer_, he will become a Toon Rabbit as much as a non-Rabbit toon that do the same.

Humans in a ___Toon Area___ can use _Toon Logic_ and _Illogical Logic_ normally, but they can't ___Break the Fourth Wall___, at least by themselves. A Toon, however, can ___Break the Fourth Wall___ and invokes its effects against a Human, with the same rules and benefits being applied to the Human.

> ___Example:___ Sargent Stout is on a big mess now: while chasing Don Rinozzo he got into the elevator pit at 43593th floor in Toon Town's Ritz Hotel without looking whether the elevator was there (_spoiler:_ wasn't). Now he's falling from stratosphere to Death! He then invokes ToonTown's ___Toon Area___ Aspect to avoid die in the process. The GM accepts and Pinky pays 1 FP. He falls in terminal velocity and will crashes in the end of elevator pit, but will be alive and okay...
> 
> ... but then Andraas Mousekewitz's player has the idea of ___Breaking the Fourth Wall___ to make Pinky _Fall Down_ so both of them cashes some FPs: he declares that, when seeing Pinky in trouble, Andraas got into the elevator (that was a floor above) and pushed the lever to 1st floor, making it fall straight down with Andraas crushed against it's ceil! When Pinky is almost to hit the elevator pit bottom, the elevator came and crashes against Pinky head, making him fall into the bottom, the elevator into shambles, both Andraas and Pinky looking like two concertinas, stars circling their heads.

### Superstar Rule: Gettin' Toony

Under this rules, a real human can get into toon, given time and circumstances.

Each time a real human:

1. Invokes a ___Toon Area___ aspect to use _Toon Logic_ and fails on a Defense roll being _Careful_ or _Sneaky_ with a _Fair (+2)_ Difficult or;
2. suffer a Consequence from a Toon provoked attack (this include things like use _Hare Restorer/Remover_ or _Jekyll/Hyde Potions_);

The character will suffer a Consequence that is related with the fact he's becoming a Toon. This _Toonin' Out Consequence_ can't be normally healed (GM Discretion on if/when he could rename or remove this Consequence)

The _Toonin' Out Consequences_ needs to show the kind of Toon he is turning on: if John Calloway is turning into a Rabbit, his _Toonin' Out Consequences_ could be ___Big, Floppy Ears___, ___Fluffy Cotton Tail___ or ___Craving for some Carrots___, or anything else. This doesn't need to be pre-setted, but all the _Toonin' Out Consequences_ needs to be clear about the kind of toon he is going into.

If he suffers a Consequence under those circumstances and this specific attack take him down, those Consequences will be turned into an _Extreme Consequence_, showing he's now a Toon, changing his High Concept to show this fact. The GM should rebuilt the character with the player help, converting the common Approaches to the Toony ones, based on the guidelines previously shown.
