## Stunts [Refresh: 3]

+ ___I’ve Read about That!:___ You’ve read hundreds—if not thousands—of books on a wide variety of topics. You can spend a fate point to use Lore in place of any other skill for one roll or exchange, provided you can justify having read about the action you’re attempting. For Magic, it demands 2 Fate Points.
+ ___Grimoire:___ When you’re making something you’ve created before, you gain +2 to your Alchemy roll.
+ ___Alchemical Salves:___ You can use a Fate Point to use Alchemy instead of _Zaps_ or _Geasa_. Still need to prepare the salve normally via Crafts.
