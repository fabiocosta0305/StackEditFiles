# Operation: SANTA

## A Wearing the Cape Adventure

This is an adventure for a group of 2-6 Capes, A-Class Campaign Level (16 CFSP). It's recommended that the characters being A-Class into their Power Types. It would be useful that at least one of them is a Mentalist or some similar Power-Type. There's no restriction on Power Types.

### Introduction - Santa in The Event

_"Yes, Virginia! There is a Santa Claus!"_

This phrase is more truth in the Post-Event world than ever.

As in other cases, the most famous being Chicago Sentinel's Ozma, there is a guy the claims to be Santa, and have all the credential to.

Sven Carlsberg, a Swedish-American guy claims that he is Santa, after signed the _Santa Clause_, that he claims to be the source of all power and legend into Santa Claus myth. Albeit not listed at _Barlow's Guide to the Superhuman_ (by his own asking), he is a known (somewhat) Cape, for the _Ur-Type_, sub-typed as one of the _Christmas Spirits_, people whose breakthrough and powers are related with Christmas myths.

According to him, some days after the Thanksgiving in the Event Year, he donned the Santa Suit, gave to him by Bernhardt, Christmas' Village Elf-in-chief. As it was investigated (classified information) Bernhardt and some other elves come to our world in the Event, for reasons and ways they don't know. As soon they found that Santa wasn't there, they sent some _Christmas Letters_ for people all around the world, with the same text:

_"We need you back, Santa!"_

From those that received those, many just thrashed or burnt the letters as an elaborate prank. Those who got and saw the map to North Pole and to contact the elves got there. Some just though all this as a craziness and wanted to got back: those had their memory on the place fuzzied, so they took all this as a dream, albeit a good one.

The ones that believed, many of them had doubts on being good enough to being Santa, even wanting to stay at the Christmas' Village: those signed their own _Santa Clauses_, becoming new Elves, _Christmas Spirits_ (Ur-Type capes) that were preparing everything until the one that would become Santa came.

Sven was the last one. And he donned the Santa Suit, becoming Santa.

It was when _North American Aerospace Defense Command_, NORAD for short came into the history.

Since 1950s, NORAD (than CONAD) played with the idea of "tracking Santa" during the travel all around the world. [NORAD Santa Tracking][wikipedia-noradsanta] was a tradition started with a misspelled ad from a store promising that they would track Santa that led to the telephone of a Colonel at the CONAD. With time, they chose to stay "on the mission" of "tracking Santa", even opening a volunteer force of civilian to track Santa.

But came The Event. And with it, the first Cape Era Christmas

It was weird when the radar guys found a very, very VERY fast UFO in the radars. Some thought it was a foo fighter. Some thought it was some irregular flying dude (there was no _Barlow's_ or Power Type concept them to say it was an Atlas). But, for some reason, the weird signal had a transponder code visible on the radars.

_Sierra-Alpha-Nevada-Tango-Alpha_.

SANTA.

It was chaos.

NORAD opened a war room. Some blamed NORAD Santa Trackers as a really bad prank to be done on one of the worst days to mess with Air Traffic Control. Some said it was the Russians playing mind games with them for war. Some even thought it was a Super-villain coming to show his power on a now paranoid-ridden society where people were becoming super-powered out of nothing.

But it was when ICAO (_International Civil Aviation Organization_) and other countries said they saw the same thing under their air-spaces. The transponder code could exchange to, for example, _Nevada-Alpha-Tango-Alpha-Lima_ (NATAL, Portuguese for _Christmas_) or _Papa-Nevada-Oscar-Echo-Lima_ (P-NOEL, short for _Père Noël_, French for _Santa Claus_). But it had the same characteristics, and even the same transponder frequency.

Everyone came to the same result.

Yes, Virginia! 

Now, ___there was___ a Santa Claus!

Next year, with a calmer (somewhat) situation, some protocols were established. Into a "official black-ops", Blackstone, Atlas, Ajax and some other capes gone to the Christmas' Village and talked with Sven, or better, with _Santa_. They put into accord that a super-fast reindeer pushed flying sleigh could be a danger for commercial aviation, and that in the last year just there wasn't a tragedy thanks to the anti-aviation paranoia the Event fueled, with all the cases involving airships that fell down thanks for the no-electricity 3.2 seconds.

Sven understood and came under some rules to avoid problems. He now has his official registry _Sierra-Alpha-Nevada-Tango-Alpha_ (SANTA), and transponder. His sleigh was programmed with all the main airways to avoid contact with commercial flights and had a [TCAS][wikipedia-tcas] and [ADS-B][wikipedia-adsb] installed on it.

The second year was really even more fun for kids: the NORAD Santa Tracker said for them information that just coherent with what shown on Internet. Some pilots even said during international overseas flights at Christmas _"Ladies and Gentlemen, at this moment we have Santa's Sleigh over us. Merry Christmas!"_

Very few knew that this information was REAL.

But some kids knew: those that received the present they need. The war-stricken refugee that found a ball at the door of his UNHCR Barrack. The guy that found into his sock a check for the money he needed to pay for his kid leukemia treatment. The bad kid that found a skunk ready to stink him for all the mean things he did at the year when opened the package where he hoped was an airsoft rifle.

All those simple gestures, times 7.6 billions.

With time, the protocols were improved: as they knew Santa importance, some guys made NORAD turns Santa Tracking into a classified, civil-military operation, even with some capes on it (specially those from _Heròs Sans Frontières_). All the intel related with Santa are now classified, albeit here and there the sightings and proofs of Santa existence was leaking. It was okay: we had _Atlas_, _Ajax_ now, why not Santa?

But there was a question in the air for those who believed, from the little kid to the old men that Wore the Red Suit.

What would happen if, for some reason, _there would be no Santa at Christmas_?

### Scene 1 - At NORAD

The capes were called to get at Peterson Air Force Base, next Colorado Springs Municipal Airport, Colorado Springs, Colorado, US. This is the place were it is NORAD Headquarters. They were called by the NORAD Commander Brigadier Sutton. Curiously a Canadian guy on the command of NORAD, even on those turbulent post-Event times. They were invited based on their success on previous missions or they were just chosen because they are low-profile capes under the cape-love forums and so (reasons are GM discretion).

After the common clearance checks and granting, Brigadier Sutton takes them to a room with a stylized logo: looks like a military one, but there was some packed gifts and mistletoe festoons drawn around here. The logo is like NORAD's one, but a little more, there's no other way to describe, "festive". A ___Average (+1)___ _Discernment_ Overcome roll will show them this is basically a Holiday version of NORAD Emblem. When they get into, it is a kind of _war-room_, not too much afar from the Dispatch rooms they are somewhat accomplished with. The climate is a little more festive, true: there's festoons, some even with mistletoe and tinsels everywhere. There was a faint pine smell and looks like there was too much people drinking hot cocoa with marshmallow and cinnamon for a military room, by the smells and mugs into a corner. Some of the soldiers there were using Santa's hat and even Santa Helper's hat, and the civilian contractors where all using all kind of Christmassy clothes, even some of them using the traditional ugly sweaters.

All around there was screens with maps, like in all situation rooms, and people on telephone, internet chat-room and so. But instead of saying about "tangos" and "stations", they were saying for kids that _"yeah, that's Santa contact email"_ and _"For sure! Astra knows Santa, didn't you saw in_ Sentinels?". 

This is NORAD Santa Tracking War-room.

When they get into it, a guy into the opposite side of the room get over and salute Brigadier Sutton, that replies the salute. This is Colonel La Sarte, Commander of NORAD Santa Tracking operation. They get nearby and start to shake hands with the capes. An ___Average (+1)___ _Alertness_ roll will show that he his really somehow stressed, and that something is wrong. As soon he finishes, he ushers the capes to another room, an empty meeting room: there was some binders with NORAD logo on it and some pens and paper, very formal. As soon they sit, they'll see that all the binders are sealed, with a CLASSIFIED stamp over it.

As soon the capes sits (we believe they will), Brigadier Sutton will get nearby the screen in the front, with NORAD (the main one) logo and says:

> _"First of all, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you understand that everything you see on this room, and on this mission, is classified information. It's important that all this information stays secret, as they involve some kind of 'soft base' of our society."_

Then, Colonel La Sarte will explain the capes about the existence of Santa (as by _Introduction_). Show them that looks like all a big pile of balderdash...

Unfortunately to them, a __COHERENT__ big pile of balderdash.

Show then that, as Colonel La Sarte says: ___"Yes, Virginia! There is a Santa Claus!"___ (this is an Aspect on adventure).

He looks worried and then he explains:

> _"As we said, after we discovered about Sven Carlsberg, or better, Santa, we established protocols on what to do, dealing with all possibilities involving him. One of them is about the SANTA transponder. We could not let any crazy guy use_  Sierra-Alpha-Nevada-Tango-Alpha _registry all of nothing, this could be a big security blunder! However, at the same time we can't just fly and try to take down someone using_ _Sierra-Alpha-Nevada-Tango-Alpha_: _how could POTUS came on TV and say that US killed Santa?"_
>
> _"To solve this, we made a validation protocol: during the year, Christmas' Village get into contact with us. The time between the contacts go nearer as the year passes, until they got daily after Thanksgiving. During the week before Christmas, they got half-daily and so."_
>
> _"And the problem is... Recently Christmas' Village ceased to contact us. We don't know what happened, but some surveillance satellites shown there was some kind of problem in the region... There was no real way to get photos there, because we believe that Christmas' Village is a pocket dimension anchored into our world since The Event. The fact that even our best Vernes weren't able to do anything that can be used to successful survey Christmas' Village is somehow a response for this."_
>
> _"We need you for a main reason after all: you are unaligned with governments, being on civilian organizations. Any military operation on this place could raise some unwanted and undesired flags: it would be like look for those governments and say 'hey pals, we don't believe you can take care for Santa, let us do the job'. And with all that happened last decade, this would be a real problem."_

Let the PCs ask all the questions they want. Main questions:

+ __Will we have any supplies?__
  + > _"We can't provide military grade supplies, this would call too much attention. However, we can provide transport, adequate clothes and other basics, like food and so."_
+ __And about support?__
  + > _"Unfortunately, this is a red-op: we don't want to be seen as meddlers into foreigner space. You'll go via_ Heròs Sans Frontières _convoy."_
+ __And about other capes in the region?__
  + > _"There's some_ Heròs Sans Frontières _capes you'll find at your_ rendezvous _at Rovaniemi, on Lapland Finland._

The question everyone would be doing is: _"How we'll find Christmas' Village if all you said is true? If it's a Pocket Dimension that surveillance satellites can found, how could us?"_

It is when Colonel LaSarte shows them a device that looks like a brass made compass, but when they look, it has a fifth cardinal point:

> _"This was given to us by Bernhardt, Elf-In-Chief, and it's called_ North Pole Compass. _All our investigations on Christmas Village shown that normal compasses just spins like a top as far they got into Arctic. But this one shows were to go when there. You see that mark with a small mistletoe branch? This is what we call Christmas point. No matter what, follow this point and you'll sooner or later get into Christmas' Village. However, take care: the Arctic is unforgiving. We lost some guys on a recent reconnaissance mission on there. Take real care."_

After this briefing, they receive some pack with some food, water, batteries for cellphones or other common devices and some pocket money, either dollars and euros, to emergencies. They are also conducted to the Colorado Springs Municipal Airport, to take a flight to O'Hare International Airport, where a _Heròs Sans Frontières_ flight is ready to them.


### Scene 2 - The Voyage to North Pole (Optional)

You can skip this if you want, but this is a good depressurizing for those who wants some of the oldy goldy SOCK WHAM BIFF OOOF!

The capes are into a A400M Atlas freighter for _Heròs Sans Frontières_. The pilots doesn't know about what is called _Operation: SANTA_: as far they know, the capes just need a ride till Rovaniemi, and, how convenient, they were going to there to take some supplies for HSF operations in the Chinese States, going the long run till there via Russia Federation.

There's some other capes there: two B-Class Atlases and a C-Class Verne with an Ornithopter. 

Let them talk a little with the other capes: they are going for the Chinese States to help into the humanitarian mission there. The supplies are basically drugs and food, with some basic energy and telecom infrastructure things added to make things easier.

Some time after they start, they'll hear the captain playing a Red Alert:

> _"All the capes to your stations. There's tangos nearby, repeat, there's tangos nearby. Sky pirates. Can't confirm any affiliation, though."_

When they finish to hear this, they receive some Earbugs from the other capes and the backdoor opens.

GM, note that everyone should hold themselves in the airplane: not doing this can be dead for all the non-flying capes, as they are ___30k feet over Atlantic___. Otherwise, the Sky Pirates are fully equipped with ___Vernetech Ornithopters___.

Here, GM, you have two choices:

1. Those guys are "vanilla" Sky Pirates: they can range from common mooks with Ornithopters to C-Class Atlases or other flying capes. Those guys are there to rob the cargo in the flight, making the pilot get down into some lost island while they either take the cargo and scavenge the airplane for the spare parts. In this case, they are just into a vanilla situation. On this situation, there's 1 Sky Pirate per PC, plus 4;
2. Those guys looks like "vanilla" Sky Pirates. However, a _Alertness_ ___Good (+3)___ roll will show that they are far from it: those guys are using sticks to fly and they are all dressed into black. Their faces are white and his eyes are from an icy-blue, totally out of expressions. Their clothes has a weird feature: their chests are opened and sewn in a way that shows their ___Frozen Hearts___. Those are, in fact, _Cold-Hearted_, some of the evil and tragic lieutenants created by the evil Ice Queen magic of _Heart Freeze_. They only "lives" to serve their lady and they doesn't have any feeling beside the desire to serve her. They are, in this case, focused on the PCs. There's 2 Cold-Hearted for each of the PCs, plus 1. Their focus is to take the _North Pole Compass_ and/or defeat the PCs.

Considering everything is okay (we hope so), they land at the new HSF base at Rovaniemi.

### Scene 3 - Rovaniemi

First things first, the Arctic is ___Painfully cold___ for those not accomplished with so low temperatures, even more now in Winter. Second, as Rovaniemi is part of Lapland, that is beyond the Arctic Circle, they are nearby the Eternal Night period, as during the Winter there's few hours of light during the day. 

If they want to ready themselves to their missions, the money provided at NORAD will be more than enough to rent (or even buy) some snowmobiles or a dog sleigh, but some rations and a map. They can even take the services from a local. Metsästäjä (Metashtaea - Finnish for "Hunter" - real name: Albearta Benne Mylläri) is a Paragon guy that works for HSF as a tracker when they need to do a mission in the Arctic. He knows lots about the region, including all the Sami farms and huts in Lapland and how to guide reindeers (in fact, almost all kind of beast of burden). He had already had his share of adventure and so and now likes to do their jobs in Lapland.

If they hide their mission, Metsästäjä will show them to a reindeer, Ávgos, his main way of travel and "best friend, better than any human", that will react against the character, as he can _smell when people is hiding things_. As far they open the book (if they didn't did this before), he'll say.

> _"Looks like this time Sven gone too far... or maybe some enemy of Christmas had come. I don't know. However, what I know is: you'll die if you go there without a guide. Even with_ The North Pole Compass, _the cold will kill you: many electronic devices stop working and even breaks into a so big cold as the Lapland Arctic. Even more, you'll be easy prey for wolves. Believe me, I saw a wolf take a good bite of a C-Class Ajax once. This place is hard and unforgiving, and being alone on this is suicidal, even more without someone accomplished on being there"_

If they accept Metsästäjä, he'll make than understand that _"until we get into Christmas' Village, my word is law. I say run, you ask so fast; I say jump, you ask so far; I say go away, you just do it."_

If they didn't bought supplies, he'll laugh and take them for _"some essential item shopping"_, with food (lots of canned meat), water on good canteens, flashlights and light-sticks, torches and other ways to generate fire, and so. Also, he'll ask if they want to go via snowmobile or sleigh. 

Everything being okay, when the sun goes down (3 PM!) they'll go into the Arctic... And to Christmas' Village.

### Scene 4 - Into the Arctic

Now, if you didn't put any enemy or if your capes had a easy time against them, this is a good place to do this.

The first two days are very okay: as Albearta shows the way into the cold white Lapland, they could see here and there the Sami huts and farms all around. He even suggest the capes (at least the non flyers) to learn on how to mount a reindeer _"as they are sometime better than snowmobiles in the snow"_. At each place they are resupplied and can have a time on the legendary Finnish saunas, _"a tradition we would never replace by no vernetech in the world"_.

At the third day, they got somewhere into a forest: there's no more huts or farms nearby. Things looks a little grim, as they have only Northern Lights as company in the long hours between the small time with sun. 

And it is when they hear some scream and bleats.

There is some of the Cold-Hearted, mounted into a kind of reindeer version of them. 

If they place themselves ready to fight, Albearta will say:

> _"Don't be fools! They are big in numbers and knows the terrain! And, to be fair, I believe we are already nearby the Christmas' Village!"_

Which is truth: if any of the capes has a common compass, they'll see that it spins around like a top.

If they want to fight, put a real horde of Cold-Hearted, 3 per PC, plus 2 for Albearta. Turn it into a blood-sport, even if the PCs win.

If they want to run, treat this into a _Contest_ between the PCs and the Cold-Hearted. Only one of the Cold-Hearted will roll for them. 

If the PCs lose the Contest, they'll be circled by the Cold-Hearted, that wants the _North Pole Compass_... And to take the PCs as hostage. Let them fight a little until the cavalry came: they'll see some _Christmas Elves (Santa Helpers)_ going for the rescue. Their numbers are a little small, but they have some kind of vernetech toy weapons, even some Toy Soldiers to help them. After they make the Cold-Hearted go away (only a few of them), they'll take the PCs back Christmas Village.

If the PCs win the Contest, they will see the Christmas' Village at the same time they'll see the Cold-Hearted turning back to the Arctic, disappearing into a mist.

### Scene 5 - Christmas' Village

Christmas Village is a Miracle after all that time lost in the white wilderness of the Arctic. A cozy-looking big house (or small castle), there's lots of pine and mistletoe festoons and tinsels everywhere, bright Christmas Baubles brightly showing. Circled by a wall with some Santa Helpers armed with bows and funny looking blunderbusses and swords. As they get into the walls, there some small cottages and lodges, big enough for the PCs but with a dollhouse looks.

Everyone and everything there is garishly colored, on strong shades of green, yellow, red, blue, the so-called _Christmas Colors_. There's a faint smell of gingerbread, cookies, pine and cocoa, aside of sawdust and fabric. A faint instrumental Christmas music can be heard everywhere, while all around Santa Helpers looks occupied readying everything for Christmas.

The Helpers (they prefer to be called this instead of "elves") are from almost all sides, although they could see it was rare to have a Helper bigger than 5'6": the average size looks somewhere 4'10" to 5'. There are Helpers with all colors of eyes, hair and skins. The main distinctive features are the petite snubby noses, pointed ears and blushed cheeks. Almost all of them uses pointed hats, although there was also those who uses bonnets, hats, casquettes and so on. They use heavy clothes on the garish colors, on a somewhat "medieval European" style, but even this way some people uses traditional clothes from other places, like Japan, China and Andine America.

Before they get into the main building, they are greeted by one of the biggest Helpers there: 6' tall, with a somehow Italian look with dark hair, he uses something like a Florentine renaissance clothes, velvety on dark green and white on some places, a Tudor dark green flat cap over his black curly hair. His green eyes are older than his completion could say otherwise.

He greets the PCs saying he's Bernhardt, Elf-In-Chief and second at the Christmas' Village aside Santa. He also ask the PCs on why they and Metsästäjä are there. If they say something beside the truth, Bernhardt just gives a smile and says them that _"you don't need to lie."_. If they say the truth that NORAD sent them, Bernhardt will usher them into the main building, saying that _"we need to talk"_.

Inside the main building, they could see that it was built even _inside_ the ice and earth: lots of levels full of Helpers and machines building all kind of toys and gifts, even _real real_ computer games and so! There's a somehow coordinated mayhem of people goes here and there, bringing toys and wrapping things and pushing it to warehouses and so. There is benches where they could see, with Helpers building toys, from dolls and wood toys, to people building some micro-electronics to replicate the brand-new games!

They also could see a guy walking everywhere, talking to everyone, a smile in his face, here and there giving some help. He's dressed into red velvety pants with suspenders, white shirt with golden buttons and big black boots. He has big white hair and beard, with gloves. He has a pearl-white smile and blushed cheeks, grey eyes behind golden glasses.

This is Sven Carlsberg, or better, Santa...

### Scene 6 - The Siege

Bernhardt ushers the PCs to Santa, and he greet the PCs. As far he knows that the PCs were sent by NORAD, Santa bring them to his meeting room. There some cookie and cocoa mugs everywhere, so they can eat some tasty treats before hearing Santa talks.

They could see there was a terminal that looks too much like those from NORAD Santa Tracker. If they ask Santa about this, he'll say that that was the terminal he uses to contact NORAD for the protocol about _Sierra-Alpha-Nevada-Tango-Alpha_:

> _"This would normally be used every 12 hours on this time, but for some reason we are electronically sieged."_

How this, they would say, and Santa will show into a screen what looks like Christmas' Village blueprints. And there's what looks like a shield.

> _"I don't know how, but they did a electronic block, messing with the signals we use to communicate outside Christmas' Village. We are without Internet since some days, and also we could not send messages for the protocol with NORAD since then. We sent some Helpers to go to Rovaniemi, but they were attacked by the Cold-Hearted. Which is weird, as there's too much of them nowadays that had before."_

They could ask about the Cold-Hearted, and then Santa will say:

> _"They are the most evil magic the Ice Queen could do: by taking people, preferably children, and open their chest into her castle rooms or into other places under their magic influence, they could be frozen to almost dead, and then frozen literally into their last heart beat, losing all his memories and emotions and becoming drones without will under the Queen's influence. They are tragical, and there's no known way to bring them back: the better we could do is to bring them a merciful, painless death."_

Any Verne that have time and tools (easy peasy on the Christmas' Village) could analyze that electronic siege. If their _Eureka!_ specialization justify, he can try to Overcome the ___Electronic Siege Field___, but will be not that easy: he is a ___Fantastic (+6)___ DR Aspect to be overcome by a Verne. Allow them to try any crazy thing they want, as far they are at least somewhat scientific.

They can try to find the generators, as it is obvious this Field is somewhat generated. Here, there's two choices for you, GM, to put:

1. The field is generated by a ___generator array___ a mile away from Christmas Village. The generators are placed into the snow in the correct places and can be taken away and deactivated easily. This is the good news: the bad news is that there's at least 1 Cold-Hearted nearby each array. As they are ___Locked into their last heart beat___, snow is nothing for them, and they use the snow as cover to avoid being detected (___Great (+4)___ _Alertness_ to be detected). As soon the first of the generators are deactivated, the ___Electronic Siege Field___ DR get down the difficult by one each (6 generators all around). However, at each turn after, there's a chance that the _Night Blizzards_ (the Christmassy supervillians) to detect the PCs actions: the PCs needs to do an _Alertness_ check against the number of deactivated generators. In a Fail, they were detected. The PCs can ask help for the _Snow Men_ to protect them.
2. The field is generated by a ___field generator___ that was installed INTO the Christmas' Village. This mean one of the Santa Helpers' is a traitor, a double-agent for the Night Blizzards. In fact, there's an Helper called _Leon_ that is uneasy with the PCs. If discovered and confronted, he'll say the truth: as soon he became a Santa Helper, he discovered her little sister, Amelia, was kidnapped by the Night Blizzards. They asked him to bring the generator into Christmas Village, and to install it somewhere. As he is from a maintenance team, he installed the generator nearby the power generator for Christmas' Village. If the PCs find the generator, they'll see it has a bomb implanted on it! Treat as a Contest if they try to disarm, but if they fail, the bomb will hit them with a WR 12 _Area Attack_, minus 4 for each victory they had! The bad news is that, as soon the generator is deactivated, the _Night Blizzards_ will know.

As soon they deactivate the field, they discover they revealed themselves to the Night Blizzards.

### Scene 7 - The Night Blizzards

The Night Blizzards are a group of villains that appeared as soon Santa revealed themselves. There was some registered actions of them all around the world during the Holidays every year, but their actions at Lapland turn everything a mess: they are a big problem for Finnish, Swedish and Danish governments. They are _Ultra_-Classes villains, albeit their _Christmas Spirit_ (Ur-Type) level is below Santa. However, they had some extra powers by themselves, as they are representations of the bad side of the Christmas time:

+ _Krampus_, a B-Class Ur-Type _Christmas Spirit_ and B-Class Ajax is a real monster: with claws and teeth he is known by kidnapping and devouring kids. He also is known of playing by the rules: he never attack innocent kids, although he loves to take those how thinks are innocent because they play "innocent pranks" (normally bullies). He is a furious monster and a killing machine, but he's a _smart_ one, and thinking he's an animal is a good way for defeat and death!
+ _The Grinch_ (real name: Gabriel Maarten Meinhoff) is the Verne of the team, and his love is to replace gifts Santa gave for kids for more "funny" (his words) versions, with lots of explosives! At least 30 kids had endured severe wounds after playing with his Howdy Boys' Toys. There's even a case for a kid that undergone breakthrough after a toy bear exploded and brought his house down, becoming a B-Class Ajax. Part Swedish, part German, he is a grouchy, non-nonsense guy, that turned into a green furry creature. He doesn't give a damn for nothing except being grouchy and spoil Christmas in any ways, preferably hurtful.
+ The _Ice Queen_ (real name: Agnetha Förkylning) is the representation of the callousness, is as beautiful as it is callousness, although she is into a callous, cold, inhuman way. As a Merlin, she also controls blizzard and cold and all the symbolic meanings of cold, including cold heart. She has a army of _Cold Hearted_, their lieutenant created by evil inhuman magic by freezing people into their last heartbeat. 

Their plan is simple: to create a Santa-less Christmas. As no one knows what would happen if there is no Santa into a Christmas, they think they can profit on this by their own evil and selfish ways. For this, The Grinch created the electromagnetic field to siege electronically Christmas' Village. Krampus is kidnapping kids and those kids are being turned into Cold-Hearted by the _Ice Queen_. 

They want also to extinguish with the _Santa Clause_: it's believed they would eliminate Santa from people hearts and from the world culture by killing the current Santa ___and___ to destroy the Santa Suit. They doesn't know if this can be done, and the Ice Queen wants to do this ritually, to absorb Santa's power!

However, they are not a _Team_, strictly saying: they also have their grudges between themselves. They all have their own agenda and doesn't trust each other. Krampus is just the henchman, knows and likes this: he loves violence and death. The Grinch is on this for destruction and to "improve" Santa's toys with his own Rowdy Boys' versions.

The real mastermind here is the Ice Queen.

She's the one who wants to take the Arctic as their own dominion, and Santa is on her way, as all the warmness and fuzziness from Christmas' Village is anathema

As soon the PCs deactivate the siege field, they'll see they are now on target of the Night Blizzards, with an horde of Howdy Boys' Toy Soldiers and Cold-Hearted there, leadered by Krampus and The Grinch, to trample and destroy as much of Christmas' Village on the process.

This will be a harsh table...

... and a Pyrrhic one: as soon they "win", they'll look around and see...

Santa's missing!

### Scene 8 - Rescuing Santa

They'll don't need to think too much to see: the Ice Queen used Krampus and The Grinch as a distraction.

Her real target was Santa.

A parchment was craved with a ice spike straight in the Christmas' Village's door. The parchment is written on a flamboyant silver calligraphy:

> _"Santa is mine now! Surrender yourselves and become my thralls! There's no hope for you! Winter is mine!"_

Bernhardt will say where to find Ice Queen castle: curiously, on this time of the year, both castles are straight in line of sight, at some miles one another (5 minutes flying for an A-Class Atlas). Bernhardt says that _normally_ their dominions goes further away as the times goes warmer and goes nearer as the times grew darker. 

Just going to the Castle would be easy...

If there wasn't all the Cold-Hearted in the way. 

For this, we'll use two Countdown timer as by _Fate Adversary Toolkit_

> ### The End of Santa Ritual
> 
> + ___Countdown:___ ( )( )( )( )( )
>   + ___Trigger:___ once per turn

To use the countdowns: mark one of the box each time the Trigger event happens. Take care to tick the triggers accordingly, specially in the _Cold-Hearted in the way_: those are the enemies the PCs needs to defeat before getting into the Ice Queen Castle Lab.

When they get into the Lab, they'll see that Santa was now naked bare, chained into a ritual table, the Santa Suit over a small table aside, while the Ice Queen is doing some kind of ritual. Of _The End of Santa Ritual_ is full, they'll see that the Ice Queen is now channeling some energy from Santa, that looks like howling in pain: his life force AND the Santa's Mantle (the energy from the _Santa Clause_) is being absorbed by the Queen.

Now, there's an _incredible_ trouble: if _The Santa's Mantle draining_ starts, the Evil Queen receive a +1 bonus each box checked on it _in all rolls_. The PCs can use any kind of way to ___Block___ this, but they'll need to roll against her _Presence_. However, if they do this, a Merlin can try to revert the magic to give the Santa's mantle back to Santa, cleaning some boxes.

There's a good chance of, if the PCs are not good enough, Santa be dead. If this happen, the only way to not have a problem on all this is to someone else sign the _Santa Clause_ by donning the Santa Suit. It's as easy to do this as to take their own clothes and dress the Suit over. But, if they had ever questioned about the Santa Clause, they'll be quoted that the it states that _"in putting on the suit, the wearer waives any and all rights to any previous identity, real or implied, and fully accepts the duties and responsibilities of Santa Claus in perpetuity until such time that wearer becomes unable to do so by either accident or design.”_ So, all his powers goes away and he became Santa, and although he maintains his own memories and knowledge (sort of), he'll became Santa!

They'll accept to pay the price to save Christmas? If not, ___dreadful things will happens!___

### Epilogue -  And every mother’s child is gonna spy...

Everything being okay (hope so), the PCs defeated the Night Blizzards, that will run away or will be destroyed... Not that they'll be destroyed forever: as all Christmas Spirits, is too much difficult to just obliterate one of them once and forever, and so they'll reappear next Holidays or in next... Ready for vengeance against the PCs.

If Sven was killed in the ritual by the Ice Queen, Bernhardt will cry a little, but they'll do what they could to save Christmas: the gifts are ready and so, the problem is how to find a new Santa. Maybe some of the PCs will don the Santa Suit and become Santa (if didn't did it yet), but Bernhardt will say the truth about the Santa Clause and that _"You put on the suit, you're the big guy"_. 

If they were also into Christmas' Eve (GM discretion), Santa (either Sven or the new one) will offer a ride for the PCs, after saying NORAD that _"Sierra-Alpha-Nevada-Tango-Alpha is asking clearance for take-off."_

And they'll go around the world...
