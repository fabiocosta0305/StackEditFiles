Normally they looks like their own compleition on his "previous life", albeit with snow white (or ashes' black) skin, icy blue eyes and white body hair. Their hair also looks like mede on ice shards. They normally uses black clothes with a icy rose pingent on it. Some of them have their shirt open in the chest, showing their cold hearts, turned into a white heart-shaped piece of ice. There's no known way to undo the Cold Hearted transfiguration, but some says that there's some ways to break the Ice Queen control.
