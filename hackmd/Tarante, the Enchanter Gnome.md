+ __*Fairy Dust:*__ Using a Fate Point, he can _Enchant_ automatically a target (non-voluntary ones can resist by Will)
+ __*Nose for Trouble:*__  You can use Empathy instead of Notice to determine your turn order in a conflict, provided youâ€™ve gotten a chance to observe or speak to those involved for at least a few minutes beforehand during this scene.
+ __*Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo!:*__ He can use _Geasa_ magic to exchange the character appeareance, changing temporaly his _Seventh Aspect_, paying 1 Fate Point. If the targwet is non-voluntar, he can defend itself by _Will_ against Tarante's _Geasa_
