## Stunts [ Refresh: 3 ]

+ ___Always Making Useful Things:___ You donâ€™t ever have to spend a fate point to declare that you have the proper tools for a particular job using Crafts, even in extreme situations (like being imprisoned and separated from all your stuff). This source of opposition is just off the table. 
+ ___Strength From Determination:___ Use Will instead of Physique on any overcome rolls representing feats of strength.
+ ___Wolves are my enemies:___ +1 on all rolls against Wolves
