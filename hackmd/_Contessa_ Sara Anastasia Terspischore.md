## Stunts [ Refresh: 3 ]

+ ___Mind Games:___ You can use Deceive in place of Provoke to make mental attacks, as long as you can make up a clever lie as part of the attack.
+ ___One Person, Many Faces:___ Whenever you meet someone new, you can spend a fate point to declare that you’ve met that person before, but under a different name and identity. Create a situation aspect to represent your cover story, and you can use Deceive in place of Rapport whenever interacting with that person.
+ ___Lie Whisperer:___ +2 to all Empathy rolls made to discern or discover lies, whether they’re directed at you or someone else.
