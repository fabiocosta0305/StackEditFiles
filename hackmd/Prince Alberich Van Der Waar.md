## Stunts [ Refresh: 3 ]

+ _**Heavy Hitter:**_   When you succeed with style on a Fight attack and hoose to reduce the result by one to gain a boost, you gain a full situation aspect with a free invocation instead.
+ _**Shield of Reason:**_   You can use Lore as a defense against Provoke attempts, provided you can justify your ability to overcome your fear through rational thought and reason.
+ _**Demagogue:**_   +2 to Rapport when youâ€™re delivering an inspiring speech in front of a crowd. (If there are named NPCs or PCs in the scene, you may target them all simultaneously with one roll rather than dividing up your shifts.)
