# Joshua "Santa Josh" Kristoffersen

Joshua was born at Chicago at December 25th, and grew like all the kids around him. But for some reason, his parents looked aways so old...

When he gone at the high school, people started to note that he was "growing old" very fast: his skin had grown wrinkles and he got very chubby and plump, even his health being very okay.

In fact, it was when his father talked about the "family tradition": they are all Kringle's (A.K.A. Santa) Seneschals. His parents worked as Mr. and Mrs. Claus at a shopping, and now he could understand how and _why_.

After some time "learning the job" with Kringle (including know that he _isn't_ Santa, or even "nice", all the time), Joshua got back and took some classes on computers at University of Chicago, where he got a major on arts and minors on computing, business and literature: for this new age, he thought, using computers are even more important than music and _ho-ho-ho_ for do his job to reinforce belief in Kringle.

He looks like he's older than he in fact is: normally he need to show his ID to prove he's _younger_ than he looks. He has white hair and plump, cherry-red cheeks. He dresses on clothes in christmas colors. 

Nowadays, he works on _The Santa Shop_, a arts shop specialized on Santa Claus stuff and Santa School, that is property for his family. He now wants to use this to spread the belief in Christmas Magic, and he's very proficient, as he does much of the costume-making job and so. He has a fond for sweets and he is as sucker for kids, even he putting them to work when he bring them to home at cold nights.
