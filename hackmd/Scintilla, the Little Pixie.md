## Stunts [ Refresh: 2 ]

+ __*Nose for Trouble:*__  You can use Empathy instead of Notice to determine your turn order in a conflict, provided you’ve gotten a chance to observe or speak to those involved for at least a few minutes beforehand during this scene.
+ __*Psychologist:*__ Once per session you can reduce someone else’s consequence by one level of severity (severe to moderate, moderate to mild, mild to nothing at all) by succeeding on an Empathy roll with a difficulty of Fair (+2) for a mild consequence, Good (+3) for moderate, or Great (+4) for severe. You need to talk with the person you’re treating for at least half an hour in order for them to receive the benefits of this stunt, and you can’t use it on yourself. (Normally, this roll would only start the recovery process, instead of changing the consequence level.)
+ __*Fairy Dust:*__ Using a Fate Point, he can _Enchant_ automatically a target (non-voluntary ones can resist by Will)
+ __*Staff of Power:*__ You gain +2 to your Magic rolls when using a staff as a focus.
