## Stunts [ Refresh: 3 ]


+ _**Heavy Hitter:**_ When you succeed with style on a Fight attack and choose to reduce the result by one to gain a boost, you gain a full situation aspect with a free invocation instead.
+ _**Indomitable:**_ +2 to defend against Provoke attacks specifically related to intimidation and fear.
+ _**Dim Mak:**_ if _concentrate his Chi_ for a Turn, he can _Attack_ a target with +2 using his bare hands. In a Success, can reduce the result by 1 and force the stress be absorbed straight on the Consequences.
