# NPCs for  "Operation: SANTA"

## Bernhardt, Elf-In-Chief

Bernhardt is Christmas' Village Elf-In-Chief and Santa Clause Upholder since ever (at least as far everyone knows). He looks a little grouchy for a Santa Helper, but this is because he's the one that do all the red tape and bureaucracy at Christmas' Village. He looks like he could get into a temper very fast, but those who know him better knows he is 100% a Santa Helper and Santa Sven (as they call Sven Carlsberg) best friend through and through. He dresses himself into dark colors (a rare event at Christmas' Village), using Florentine renaissance clothes, velvety on dark green and white on some places, a Tudor dark green flat cap over his black curly hair. His green eyes are older than his completion could say otherwise. He did her homework on updating himself into the post-Event world where Christmas' Village is now linked to: he is as comfortable with cellphones e epads than with the old Naughty/Nice list.

## Santa Village's Elves

The Helpers (they prefer to be called this instead of “elves”) are from almost all sides, although they could see it was rare to have a Helper bigger than 5'6": the average size looks somewhere 4'10" to 5'. There are Helpers with all colors of eyes, hair and skins. The main distinctive features are the petite snubby noses, pointed ears and blushed cheeks. Almost all of them uses pointed hats, although there was also those who uses bonnets, hats, casquettes and so on. They use heavy clothes on the garish colors, on a somewhat "medieval European" style, but even this way some people uses traditional clothes from other places, like Japan, China and Andine America.

There's two kind of Elves: those that came "from before the Event" and already was there when Santa Sven came, and those who became Elves as their breakthrough and didn't signed the Santa Clause, but wanted to stay there. They change into an Aspect, some Skills/Attributes and a Stunt.
