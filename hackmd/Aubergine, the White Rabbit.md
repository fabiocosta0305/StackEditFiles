+ __*Eavesdropper:*__  On a successful Investigate roll to create an advantage by eavesdropping on a conversation, you can discover or create one additional aspect (though this doesn’t give you an extra free invocation).
+ __*Nose for Trouble:*__  You can use Empathy instead of Notice to determine your turn order in a conflict, provided you’ve gotten a chance to observe or speak to those involved for at least a few minutes beforehand during this scene.
+ __*Child of the Court:*__  Gain a +2 bonus to any attempt to overcome obstacles with Rapport  when you’re at an aristocratic  function, such as a royal ball.
