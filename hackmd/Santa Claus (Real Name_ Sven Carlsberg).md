## Appeareance

The Swedish-American Sven Carlsberg is THE Santa on look: big jolly belly, cotton white big beard and hair, wrinkled aged face with a snub nose and big smile with perfect pearl-white teeth. Naturally blushed cheeks frames his round face, with aquamarine blue eyes that looks as sparkling as a child's. When not doing "the trip" at Christmas Eve, when outside Christmas Village, he dresses always on Christmas colors (Red, Green, White, Gold) and on christmassy themes, even in Summer. He has a fonding on big black boots and vests, and dislikes ties. On Christmas Village, he is almost always dressed on The Suit. For safety reasons, when he is not on Christmas Village, he doesn't use The Suit

## History

Sven was born some years before The Event, and his remembrance on it is more or less common: he just blacked out on his job as clerk on a toy store and, in the chaos did his best to help everyone. The only weird thing is that he remembered to hear some bells jingling and the smell of pines and felt something like mistletoe's festoons touching his skin. 

But, some weeks after in the same years, before Thanksgiving, he found a small envelope, made on parchment paper, with a seal made with mistletoe. On it there was a map, and a small card saying:

_"We need you back, Santa!"_

He smiled a little on the joke: as the oldest clerk on the job (he was 28 then), he was chosen as Santa for the job since he got into while he was going into his Major on Literature and English at University of California, Berkley. But something inside himself was calling him.

He then chosed to take some vacations he had on hold and got to the North. First, he got to Europe, going to Helsinki, as the map said. From there, he rented a car till Rovaniemi, a city into the Finnish Lapland region. There, he was saw to find a guy called Bernhardt (a weird name, as he was waiting for some Finnish people). They talked a little and Bernhardt shown him a trunk.

In there there was the most luxurious Santa Suit Sven had even saw.  There was some chimes on the belt and boot cuffs. The belt buckle was real gold, and there was some round gold glasses. The velvet red suit looked so comfy that even the blizzard winter at Lapland would be nice. It even smelled of pines and licorice. For some reason, Sven thought it smelled of faith and hope and children's innocence. There was a small card in the pocket:

_"If you are ready, take the Santa Clause by wearing this suit."_

It was when he asked about this _Santa Clause_, and Bernhardt said it would be better if he saw with his own eyes, and they got into a big sleigh pulled by reindeers.

While looking in the map, Sven thought they were going on the wrong direction: they would be going to the Artic, and he was even more scared when he saw his compass spinning around like crazy. Bernhardt reassured him that _"if after all this you don't take the Santa Clause, I'll get you back somewhere so you could go back home."_

It was when Sven saw a unbelievable sighting: a village with lots of lights big and small, circled by a kind of wooden wall. When he got into it, he saw a lot of people running around, all of them with pointed ears and petite snubby perked noses and pinky cheeks, dressed on luxurious, beautiful clothes in very bright colors, all in tones from the Christmas colors of green, red, yellow and white, no pastels or blacks anywhere, very few dark colors instead. All of them, big and small, had a kind of childish look, even on those that were otherwise adults, and there was people from all skin colors.

Bernhardt them shown his own ears (that were hidden by a snow cap and big hair), and they were also pointed, and revealed himself as an elf, or better, a _Santa Helper_.

He started a talk about Christmas Village, on how they got connected back Earth after The Event and how they needed to get back to the old gift-giving job at Christmas Eve _"or else the equilibrium in the World will fall apart and no one knows what could happen."_

It was when Sven asked: _"Well, where's Santa?"_

And Bernhardt said that __HE__ would be Santa, as the previous Santa just vanished during The Event.

As soon they connected back to Earth and noticed Santa's abscense, they sent some envelopes for people that had the right spirit to potentially become Santa Claus (or Father Christmas or any other name they liked). Some of them just burnt or thrashed the envelopes. Some of them came, but refused to be Santa and were sent back the world, albeit with foggy memories on Christmas Village for their own safety. Some chosen to become Santa Helpers and so they were reading everything for Christmas.

Sven was the last one. If he didn't don the suit, there would be no Santa. And no Santa, no Christmas... And who would know what would happen?

Sven asked for some days to give the answer, and to have the Suit at his room. Bernhardt agreed.

He looked all the time for the Suit, that for some reason called him upon.

In the end of that day, he donned the Santa Suit.

And he signed the _Santa Clause_ undergoing his Breakthrough.

He started to feel a surge of memories from the past, present, future... From other places and ages, from generations of Santas and Santa's Helpers (from even before being called this way). He saw hope in times of madness, small moments of peace in war-stricken times, innocence saved or restored in disbelief cause by poverty. He saw also pain and grief and tears dropped when people said _"There's no such thing as Santa!"_, snearing to poor kids.

It was when he understood: he was ___The Santa___. The Big Boss. The Guy in the Red Suit. Father Christmas, Père Noël, Joulupukki, Kris Kringle, Babbo Natale, Julemanden, Jultomte, Papai Noel, Pai Natal...

He was a symbol of hope and faith under the direst situations.

And he would not dissapoint anyone.

Since the Christmas after the Event, he had flew around into his Sleigh being pushed by his reindeers, sending gifts and toys for good kids, and coal lumps and some pesky tricks for the bad ones. He even helps some adults here and there, giving money or helping them somehow behind the scenes. He knows lots of capes and even get out Christmas Village some time and another during the ear to walk into some city. He does his best to ask people to not say about him, as he likes to go as incognito as possible. He even gives (covertly) some gifts and toys for _Heròs Sans Frontiéres_ donate to kids on war-stricken places.

Some says that Sven knows he can not be Santa forever, and even that he is looking for some potential substitutes, to sign the Santa Clause. What will happen? No one knows, but looks like Santa Clause is the backup way Chrismas have to be a Santa no matter what, and on a place with baddies like Seif-Al-Din and The Zealot and all the hate-filled people that would shot him dead as soon as possible as a demon or a sin-bringer, it is needed.

Sven is the right jolly old elf on his behavior: cheerful and respectful, he's trustful for everyone that doesn't have evil at his heart. He also looks sage beyond his apparent age (and even more his real age), as he has access to all collected memories from past Santas. He still has lots to learn about his new condition, as he knows that other Santas have even more powers, like to looks for the True Needs people have and doesn't confess and so. But he knows that, at each Christmas Eve, he can bring some Joy to The World, and this is enough for him.
