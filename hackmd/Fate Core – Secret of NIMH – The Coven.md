# Fate Core – Secret of NIMH – The Coven

[Source](https://taoofchall.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/fate-core-secret-of-nimh-the-coven/ "Permalink to Fate Core – Secret of NIMH – The Coven")

The following is the game I run at conventions. Feel free to use it, in conjunction with [Fate Core][1] and my [original post][2], to run your own games.

My next post will cover the game I run for my players. At that stage I'll release the entirety of this NIMH project on PDF.

## **The Coven**

![NIMH Book][3]

An actual picture of my GM notes.

## 

This campaign happens many years after the 1st movie and pretends the sequel never existed. Thorn Valley  failed despite Justin's best efforts (see the movie to understand what I mean) and the Rats of NIMH fled into the city. There, they've built a Coven which rests in the shadows of human civilization.

The con blurb is as follows:

_You captured us, tortured us, made us greater than we were. We have escaped your bondage. Now we run invisible through your streets, loathed and nearly forgotten. We have made an empire from what you´ve discarded, it runs under your cities unseen. We know you, perhaps better than you know yourselves. _

## **The Big Issues**

### **Current Issue: The Nature Of Rats**

_Nicodemus had great hopes for his people, alas it was all for not. Changing location did not change Rat nature, the Thorn Valley project was plagued by  new Jenners, each vying for domination over the new kingdom, their conflicting plots choking all attempts to build a self-sufficient community.  Justin gave into his devious nature and won out through false words and backstabbing.  He then lead his people, in defeat, to the city where they survive to this day._

_Still, the light of hope has yet to be snuffed out. Perhaps a new generation of Rats can overcome the sins of their parents? _

**Place: The Coven **

The under city lair of the Rats of NIMH. It lies beneath the sewer. It's vast and holds a dark beauty, reminiscent of the Rose Bush. There are clean, spacious warrens, each with access to electricity and modern comforts. There is a great palace built into the rock wall where the Coven Elders reside, the comforts there, slightly better than what are found anywhere else. Deep inside the palace ambitious Rats conduct their favorite game, politics. It's a deadly chess match and only the most cunning survive.

Note: All Coven Faces are Rats. Non Rats, even other NIMH Critters, are forbidden entrance. The single exception is Brisby Mice  but they haven't been seen for years.

**Faces:**

* **Justin: **The same character from the movie, old and jaded. The Thorn Valley fiasco stole his courage of the heart. He can no longer wield The Stone. That being said he's gained wisdom and cunning. He rules the elder council with a poisoned touch. 
    * Justin is a playable character in this game.
* **Mortimer: **Justin's 'friend'. In the past they allied to size control of the Elder council, now however, they're simple rivals. Mortimer possesses Jenner's ambition but keeps a better facade. Most assume, wrongly, he is kinder than Justin.
* **Zora: **The neutral party between Justin and Mortimer. She's got a sharp mind and a keen ear for politics. She's tired of the game but holds on to keep Justin and Mortimer's plots from destroying the Coven. 
    * There are other elders but none as influential as these three.
* **David: **Justin and Zora's son. He's a dashing Rat of action, who has little time for politics, very much like his father when he was younger. He loves his people but holds a deep hatred for humans. 
    * Justin and Zora hold no love for each other. Theirs was a marriage of convince that ended as soon as it served its purpose. Despite this, they both love David dearly.
* **Media: **The Coven Witch, the only one with the talent to use Nicodemus' mirror and  wield The Stone. Justin supports her because, despite her non-nonsense exterior, she possesses the courage of the heart that he has lost. 
    * Media is a playable character.
* **Joshua: **While a young rat he tasted the  potion of wisdom. It drove him mad but also made him capable of great alchemy. His potions and powders ensure he is a key player in Coven politics. However, he's too delirious to know or care. 
    * Joshua is a playable character.

### **Current Issue: World of Fangs**

_Outside the Coven everything either hates you, or likes you far too much; humans, predators, NIMH critters, normal critters, NIMH itself. . . the list goes on. The Coven is full of danger but only if you cross the wrong Rat, keep your wits about you and you're safe. Outside the Coven you're prey. Still, the outside world  must be braved for supplies. Further still, there are great rewards, in allies and items, for those willing to risk it._

_Fortune favors the bold._

**Place: Death's Crossing**

![I know, I know, this is actually Saint Canard. I'll reuse this picture if I ever do a Dark Wing Duck Fate hack.][4]

I know, I know, this is actually Saint Canard. I'll reuse this picture if I ever do a Dark Wing Duck Fate hack.

The surface of the city the Rats know as Death's Crossing; cross the street at the wrong time and death comes as a roaring beast of steel. As dangerous as it is the city's surface is rich in food, parts and treasure, most of which the humans throw away.

Yes the NIMH  Rats are still thieves but most of what they take is unwanted.

**Faces:**

* **Barbarossa: **An imposing brown Rat who believes that he and his gang own Death's Crossing. They're not of NIMH. They take everything with tooth and claw. The Elders don't see them as much of a threat, but still, be careful; the have numbers and they know the streets. If you go into Death's Crossing be sure to avoid Barbarossa and his ilk.
* **Dante: **Dante's a black house cat, not of NIMH, but still incredibly dangerous. He's an expert hunter, perhaps the best there is. He follows a specific hunting path, one you'll probably have to cross if you travel in the city. Be warned, Dante never forgets a slight, draw his ire and you're doomed, on or off his path.
* **Grendel: **A thing that exists in myth and rumor. He's a creature even humans fear. No Rat has ever seen him, all Rats pray they never do.
* **Humans: **No individual Humans stands out in Death's crossing. They are less people and more juggernauts who'll crush you, carelessly, underfoot.

**Place: The Outlands**

The rural expanse outside the city is less dangerous than Death's Crossing but strange things lurk there; the Great Owl, primordial hunters and NIMH scientists just to name a few.  The Elders, though they're familiar with the Outlands, leave  adventures there to far younger, and more expendable, Rats.

**Faces:**

* **The Great Owl: **The same character form the movie. He has great wisdom but only for those brave enough to visit him and lucky enough to survive. It's rumored he's dead but can anything really kill such a being?
* **NIMH: **Their main lab is in the Outlands. They are a vile, unknowable, menace.
* **The Greys: **A strange warren of Rabbits. They have grey fur and milky eyes. They seem distantly polite and  talk in whispers. Never accept an invitation to their warren, you'll never bee seen from again.
* **Raynard The King: **A Red Fox who, through charisma and cunning, commands all predators in the Outlands. While he, and his subjects, are the most obvious threat, they can be reasoned with. They may even be amicable if food is plentiful. Raynard is fond of games, if you risk your life against him and win you'll have a boon, such a prize is no small matter.

## Player Characters

![Justin in his badass days.][5]

Justin in is badass days.

If you ever play in my con game these will be the pregens.

For your own games feel free to use these as PCs or NPCs and change them as you desire. Justin could have had more than one child, Medea doesn't have to be the wielder of the stone, perhaps a Brisby has come knocking? Go wild.

    * She's young for such an important position and she's got a lot to learn. A powerful few refuse to believe she can hack it. She'll show them otherwise.
* **Courage of the Heart**
    * Before Medea became an 'elder' she helped Aiden escape prosecution even though it would implicate her in a crime she didn't commit. A day later they were both vindicated.

* **Book of The Dead**

* **Healing Potion**
    * This potion heals a moderate injury consequence or less. It cannot be used on the same character more than once per scenario.
* **Acid**
    * This potion eats through nearly anything,of course the glass that contains it is immune. If used as a weapon, it's a one shot weapon:6.

## Nameless NPCs

![][8]

These rats are tired of your Coven Bourgeoisie nonsense.

Nameless, in Secret of NIHM, means nameless threats. These aren't obstacles you simply bowl over, you're rats, you can't do that. These are faceless predators with fangs, claws and guns who will kill you if you don't outrun them or use your head. Secret of NIMH is not about combat, it's about survival.

That being said, one can still slay the occasional giant and sometimes, rarely, you'll get a treat in hordes of inferior enemies. However,  understand this won't be the norm.

### City Slickers

**Critter Aspect: **Clueless Human

**Aspects: **Just Out On The Town

**Skills: **Rapport: Average [+1], Resources: Average [+1]

**Stunts**

**Stress**:  None

_NOTE: IMO physical attacks should always fail to take out a human. Even if you get beyond his or her scale value the best you'll be able to do is cause a scratched consequence. _

_That being said, clever use of Rapport, Deceit or Provoke could easily get a human to run away or think you're too cute to hurt. Beware the results though. Running Humans will get help and those cowed by cuteness will want to keep you as a pet. _
