## Details

Shoreh’s Iranian born parents were both seekers of truth who traveled the world with their daughter trying to learn from every source they could. They ultimately settled down near one of the larger Theosophical Society communities where their daughter was raised to value religious traditions from around the world, and the deep truths that could be conveyed through symbolism.

In her schooling, Shoreh excells in literature and theater, always having a talent for the deft use of symbolism. In fact, with practice she could design an experience for people that could inspire them, break them, or alter their perception of reality--and to her parents’ and teachers’ chagrin, she had a knack for figuring out how to make this happen off the normal safety of a stage. She would come to find a kindred spirit in the writings of Aleister Crowley, much to the displeasure of her parents.

She also had a fondness for the place of swordsmen in stories, and after much harassment from Shoreh, her parents finally paid for her to have some fencing lessons.

If Shoreh has one clear weakness, it’s that sometimes she cannot see a situation just as it is, but invests it with too much meaning. She may overreact to the neighborhood bully, because to her it’s the story of St. George versus the Dragon; she may not be able to crack a simple numerical puzzle because she’s trying to crack it with numerology instead of math; she’s likely to fail at persuading a hard-nosed practical sort because she insists on talking in metaphor and allegory.

While her parents are skeptical of tendencies that are better suited for an artist or a mystic rather than the young lady they hope to raise, Shoreh found at least one bad influence to her liking in Aisha Noorzai, a Pashtun librarian and Century Retainer who always seems to be able to get her obscure and unusual books or ritual supplies. Aisha has also helped Shoreh learn to trust herself and her sense of right and wrong, and when necessary has given her the nudge she needed to go forth and adventure.
