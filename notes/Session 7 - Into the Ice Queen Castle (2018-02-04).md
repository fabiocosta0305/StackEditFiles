## Through the Castle Sewers

In last session, the Pilgrims Donkey Teeth and Cloud Giant just get into a tunnel to break into the Ice Queen Castle, to rescue the Sugarplum Fairy, so Santa could mix her special Fairy Dust into his reindeers' fodder and do his yearly voyage all around the Many Worlds.

That was the good news.

However, the Bad News is: they found a way through its sewer. The _**filthy, smelly way**_ was also very dark, _**as a disgusting sewer**_ exit. After advancing a little, they saw a light source, but they could see in the drain from where the light came out there was _**dried blood**_. It was one of the experiments room where the Ice Queen did her experiments, mainly to create her _Cold-hearted_, they would discover later.

They could see that the sewer get a little more ahead. After some walk, they got into a grease box-like room, where all the litter from the place was thrown there. Albeit even smellier, they are brighter and there's some stairs, like it was a underground way to get out if it was a river, not a sewer.

After breaking the sewer, they got over a little bridge to get into a door, the Donkey Teeth just punch. They discover that the door was not made on wood, but on a kind of crystal like stuff, that shatters with a SMASH sound. They got into a kitchen, but the magical flames that illuminates everywhere are white-ish blue and cold.

When they find the first people in the castle!

## The Cold-Hearted

The Pilgrims found those black silk dressed guys, with a hair who looked made of icicles and a pale white face like they were exsanguinated, blue empty eyes, like a blizzard ready to mince them like meat, their opened chest with which looked like a heart-shaped crystal. _"This is not Carnegie Hall"_ is all Donkey Teeth could say, flabbergasted.

The guys looks for the Pilgrims blankly, thinking on how to react against them. One of them looks and asked who were the Pilgrims, on a blank, emotionless voice, so Donkey Teeth just say for them to just don't mind on them, while Cloud Giant says they are the castle cleaners, but with a failed _Sneaky_ roll against the guys, and no chance for Donkey Teeth get into Teamwork as her _Sneaky_ is _Mediocre (+0)_. One of them tried to get and touch a _**snowflake-shaped crest**_ over his shirt while the other guy advanced to take the Pilgrims to the Ice Queen.

But Donkey Teeth had a better reaction time and avoided the guy to touch the crest starting the conflict against the guys. Cloud Giant also go for the other guy to avoid him to touch the crest into his shirt, and he scored a _Success with a Style_ to _**Pin**_ the guy in the ground. The guy Donkey Teeth held an arm tried to attack Donkey Teeth with a kind of black magic, but she _**Pin**_ this guy also, and the Pilgrims win the Conflict, both of the guys with blank expressions looking for them, pinned in the ground. 

Donkey Teeth looks to see if she could tie them with their clothes, and she did this by take their shirts to tie them, and Cloud Giant give some Teamwork. She noted, after tie them, that the place is really _**Freeze Cold**_ but _**they feel nothing**_, even undressed to be tied: the Pilgrims themselves could feel cold, even with the warm clothes Santa provided them. Donkey Teeth say they were sorry, as they just wanted to rescue the Sugarplum Fairy, and the guys replies by saying that the Sugarplum Fairy were in the Castle's Dungeons. The guy says where the Dungeons were, but said also that there was Patrols all around.

Donkey Teeth looks for the heart-shaped crystal and for her that looked a really too much with a heart. Donkey Teeth think those are their hearts, and with a _Clever_ roll she understood why they felt nothing: remembering some of the lessons in the Flying Temple, she remembered some comments on really evil magic that _**stopped someone's heart on its last beat**_, making her _**not living, dead or even undead**_, prisioner between life and death. Donkey Teeth looks for them and, after saying they would be thankful for this, took their frozen hearts out of their chest, with the help of Cloud Giant. When they do this, the heart unfreezes, the melting blood gone through their hands literally. As soon the hearts unfroze, they gave it's last beat and stops. The guys didn't felt pain, but relief, as they were locked into their last heartbeats. Donkey Teeth felt disgusting on this, which goes even worse when the icicle hairs change back to the blonde hair they had before this magic.

They were Natalians! 

Someone said in their back: _"Don't worry. That was a better fate than what the Ice Queen had for them."_

## Jack Frost

Donkey Teeth looked around, her teeth exposed, when they saw Jack Frost: a teen, he looked somewhat like the guys they just had killed, but using a light blue blouse and white pants, using a staff also, like the one in _The Gardians_. He says that his a friend, as _**he doesn't like the Ice Queen**_ also. Donkey Teeth asks his name and he presents himself as _**Jack Frost, the name people gave him now**_. Sounds like Jack Frost was also in a mission to take back the Sugarplum Fairy, and he joined the Pilgrims as a help. 

Donkey Teeth notes that _**Jack Frost looks too much like the guys, but he has emotions**_, and Jack Frost confirms that the Ice Queen magic is not as powerful on him as it was in those guys. But he confirms he is somewhat alike those guys, lifting his shirt and showing the frozen heart as the guys have. Jack Frost says those guys are called _Cold-hearted_, and Donkey Teeth says that de Ice Queen doesn't need to take those guys hearts out, which Jack Frost confirms: all that the Ice Queen needs to do is open the guys' chest and allow the cold do the job.

It was when the Pilgrims understood that the Castle chillness is not natural: it's a kind of magical oppression, bad feelings turning the weather really cold there. The Pilgrims decided then to not only rescue the Sugarplum fairy, but to _**stop the Ice Queen**_ to do this black magic also! Jack Frost join the Pilgrims to help them on these objectives.

The Pilgrims goes with Jack Frost, noticing that, even the wall being made of ice, they could not see through them. Next corridor, just before they could open the entrance to the Dungeons, they found a _**Platoon of Cold-Hearted**_, on the other side of the corridor. As soon they see the group, they touched the crests on their shirts, which made the crystals resonates with a _**Northern Lights-like pattern**_.

An _**Silent Alarm was triggered**_!

## Rescuing the fairy

Donkey Teeth looks for Jack Frost on what to do, and he says to them to get into the Dungeons while he could stop the Cold-Hearted. 

As the Pilgrims get into the Dungeons, they noted that _**they are colder than the rest of the Castle. An oppresive cold!**_ The Dungeons are big and with lots of doors everywhere. Donkey Teeth tried to remember who is the Sugarplum fairy, but she could just remember that, according to the Flying Temple records, Fairies had the look of woman, but smaller, and otherwise their appereance varies: some looked like old grannies, some looks like pesky petite kids and so. She knows the general look for fairies and there's only a hope to not have other fairies there.

Donkey Teeth is really upset and chose to just chew out the doors. She found some kids, hungry and without proper clothes (maybe Cold-Hearted materials?), almost dying on cold, as even the Pilgrims were feeling cold, and they had warm clothes provided by Santa. 

In the middle of the Dungeon, Donkey Teeth just got into a cell with a _**little cage made of mistletoe**_. Inside it what looked like a _**butterfly winged girl on a white and blue princess dress**_. Donkey Teeth asks if she's the Sugarplum fairy, taking her as a little girl, and she confirms, ushering them to take her and get out, as the Ice Queen, or better, this Ice Queen, is really powerful. Donkey Teeth says they could deal with the Queen, but she says them that the Queen is really, really powerful.

Donkey Teeth ask for Jack, just at the time the Dungeon door is blasted by him, that was launched through the door against the opposite wall in the Dungeon, somewhat like Goku on Dragon Ball Z. He was panting, tired and hurt, saying that the Cold-Hearted were a bad sport. When they looked, there was still at least four Cold-Hearted for them and two of them using _**Magic Wands**_ with a white point in the tip of them. 

Donkey Teeth asks to bite the mistletoe, but Cloud Giant questioned about the toxicity on just chew mistletoe. Cloud Giant remembered that mistletoe is a kind of magical insulant, and Pilgrims are trained to deal with some of the most commons venoms and poisons. Cloud Giant just take the cage and break it as a common cage.

The Sugarplum Fairy is free, that's the good news.

Bad new, the Cold-Hearted are getting to them!

Donkey Teeth tried to break the Cold-Hearted wands, and she was _Successful with a Style_, not only breaking their wands, but the fronzen hearts inside them. But the hearts made Donkey Teeth felt a curse somewhat: she felt the pain and cold the guys felt when turned into the Cold-Hearted, making she feel like she was being frozen Inside Out. Donkey Teeth fell in the ground, chilling, looking for warm things, but there was none there.

Cloud Giant looked for Donkey Teeth and tried to confort Donkey Teeth, but she was really chilling, as he never felt before. Donkey Teeth said that they should find a way out, and everone agreed.

But they shouldn't had thought that the Ice Queen would let them get away that easy.

## The Ice Queen

The Ice Queen just appeared: a big woman, strong woman with a golden hair, like Jadis on _The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe_, but even more evil, asking the Pilgrims why they are there, destroying their soldiers and _"Taking what was hers by right!"_. Donkey Teeth replied their defenders were dicks and Cloud Giant agreed with her. The Ice Queen said that she didn't believed that Santa _"had gone that down to ask for help of the Pilgrims of the Flying Temple"_. 

But she was in glee also with this: she knew that _**There's no more the Temple**_, so it would be her time, by eliminate the Pilgrims, then Santa, and then taking power on the Many Worlds. _**"No more Temple, no more Santa!"**_. Donkey Teeth said that they would rebuild the Temple by defeating people like her. She chortled, saying that the Pilgrims were just teens that smelled like piss and that just recently left behind diapers. She then said she would show them what is power.

She attacked the Pilgrims, calling a Cone of Cold from her wand. Cloud Giant was hit straight in the chest, feeling a kind of cold knife, that tries to get into him and press his heart, his heart trying trying to stop! A five stress attack! He was _**Chilling Inside Out**_ (Mild Consequence) + suffered 3 Stress Damage! Donkey Teeth felt a little cold from the attack with a 1-point damage being soaked on the stress. The same attack also hit Sugarplum and Jeck Frost, knocking them back. 

And the Ice Queen brought reinforcements with big platoons of Cold-Hearted. They jumped into them, and Donkey Teeth suffered a 3-Point Attack, but avoided the stress using  Fate Points on her Aspects _"Ultimate Set of Teeth"_ and _"Now its time to prove myself to my friends"_: as the Cold-Hearted doesn't feel pain, she could go all-out on them, and she could not let the Sugarplum fairy fell into their hands. 

Cloud Giant gone to defend itself by just push them back. It was a tie, but the enemy just take the fact that he was _**Chilling Inside Out**_ to push even fiercer on him. But Cloud Giant had _**Titanic Height and Strength**_, and he used a Fate Point on it to bring it back to a tie, so no stress. That was the good news.

The bad news is that the Cold-Hearted were _**Ganging out**_ him, trying to hit him somehow. And now Cloud Giant tried to throw Donkey Teeth against the Queen. But does this while being _**Ganged out**_ was difficult, which would implies he failed, but as he has _**Titanic Height and Strength**_, and with a Fate Point he was able to throw Donkey Teeth somewhere nearby the Ice Queen. Donkey Teeth than gone to bite the Queen's face, but Donkey Teeth found that the Queen froze the air in front of her, so Donkey Teeth found herself munching ice.

Next Sugarplum Fairy rolled out the sleeves and after screaming about being enough, and done some magic passes and blasted a kind of Northern Light-kind solid  energe against the Ice Queen, hitting her straight in the head. The Ice Queen was really pissed out, as her face is revealed as a façade, a mask her uses to hide her _**Hideous, Hag-like Face**_, like acid was splashed on her face. She screams madly about kill the Sugarplum Fairy and find the _**Fairy Dust recipe**_.

Then it was Jack Frost time, that tried to do a ice wall and skate through it and hurt the Ice Queen, but she took Jack Frost and menaced, holding Jack Frost like a trophy by his neck: _**"Okay, your goody two-shoes! One step, and I'll break his throat like a twig!"**_

She snarled, gloating about how they doesn't had a chance to win over her into the her Dominion, calling them a big bunch of fools.

Donkey Teeth gulped the ice on her mouth and tried to convince the Ice Queen that things couldn't go to the bitter end, to free Jack Frost.

She looked a little unphased on parley with the Pilgrims, but agreed on it. She asked what Donkey Teeth could provide give for her in exchage for Jack Frost's life. She offered _**"Centuries of the Flying Temple Knowledge"**_. She said that both her and Santa knew that _**The Temple had Gone!**_, so the offer Donkey Teeth did was empty. When asked by Donkey Teeth if she doesn't like to learn on their teaching that she had and could pass along, the Ice Queen said that _**her powers are backed by the cold**_, so she could not have any profit on this, by learning _**"the goody two-shoes 'knowledge' from the Flying Temple"**_. Donkey Teeth asked if all that the Ice Queen wanted was Despair and Hate, as the Castle was full of them. The Ice Queen than said that _**it was despair for the weak. For her, that was power!**_.

In the meantime, Cloud Giant was seeing Donkey Teeth parleying with the Ice Queen, so he could try to free Jack Frost from Ice Queen's grasps. It's was simple: the Ice Queen was so compenetrated on parleying with Donkey Teeth that he could take his time to free Jack Frost, so his _**Simple Answers are the best ones**_ Stunt applied. It was a Tie on the roll, however: albeit he rescued Jack Frost, the Ice Queen was so furious that gone for him with ice-made claws. He gone and defend itself from the Ice Queen.

Even with casualties, the Cold-Hearted reinforcements attacked the Pilgrims. Donkey Teeth had, however, got with a _Success with Style_ and defeated some extra Cold-Hearted. Cloud Giant defended itself and used the _**Disoriented**_ boost to defend himself. Jack Frost and Sugarplum didn't were hit, but Jack Frost was _**panting**_ tired. 

Cloud Giant used his action to get Jack Frost out of there, and then Sugarplum gone again using the _**Northern Lights**_ attack and a tie made _**Sugarplum's Northern Lights and Ice Queen's Snow Cone clash each other**_ (this was a Boost for the Pilgrims). Donkey Teeth gone to get and shift the balance to them. She said Ice Queen was a _**Hideous Hag**_ (using the Consequence Free Invoke) and kicked her for a 8-Stress attack (YIKES!!!). The Ice Queen suffered another Consequence, a Severe one, gone _**Wandless**_, as Sugarplum's Northern Lights, now unlocked from the Snow Cone, hit her wand, rendered into smithereens. Jack Frost takes and hit the Snow Queen straight into her face, using the fact she was now _**Wandless**_ (using the free invoke on the Consequence), but not powerful to take him out, even hit her strong.

Donkey Teeth looked and, as the walls are all made of ice, she chosed to attack the ceiling to make some of it collapses. The Ice Queen, when saw Donkey Teeth hit the ceiling, noticed that she hitted a weak spot in the Castle, so she chose to Give In and run away. The Castle started to rumble, while the Ice Queen runned away with the remaining Cold-Hearted. That was the cue Donkey Teeth and Cloud Giant needed to run away with Sugarplum and Jack Frost. 

## Epilogue - Halfway in the jorney

As they got out, the Castle collapsed, leaving behind a kind of snow dust. They look to the sky, they saw a sledge made of ice getting out from Natal into the sky, so maybe this is not the last time they heard about the Ice Queen. 

They got back Sugarplum's hut and, in the ground, she opened a Vault, to take a parchment that had the _**Fairy Dust recipe**_. Sugarplum says that it was not that easy to prepare the Fairy Dust, and that could have some pesky perks if made wrongly.

They got back to Santa's Village and Greta and the Elves prepared some fodder laced on the Fairy Dust for the reindeers. Santa then looked for the Pilgrims, and Donkey Teeth noticed that Santa had into their clothes there was the _**Symbol of the Flying Temple**_. Donkey Teetha asked about this, and he said that the Temple made those. _**There was no way to someone live all the time Santa was heard of. Santa was a kind of title or profession that only one person could be each time.**_ The clothes was part of the _**Santa Clause signing**_, proofing he was the Santa for that time. He says that _**the Monks of the Flying Temple knew that sometime the Temple would disappear**_ and took all possible measure to ready a _**Plan B for the Many Worlds**_. 

Donkey Teeth asked if he knew why they disappeared, and he doesn't know. But he said that he left a _**Vault full of items from the Temple**_, with express orders to _**no one, even Pilgrims or Monks to access it "until it was the time"**_. Donkey Teeth asked if it was Time, and Santa said no... 

But _**they were halfway in the Journey**_.

To understand what happened.

To solve the Temple mystery.

What this means? 

We'll see next time!
