# Cabby (Real Name: Kabba Bangula)

One of the best drivers in pre-Event Africa, Kabba Bangula was born in Sierra Leone, but made career at South Africa (and all around Africa) driving categories, from the Go-Kart to the main ones. He was able enough to get into Indycar or F1 easily, but The Event changed their plans, as UNHCR needed a good driver for get all around Africa, even crossing the Sahara and Serigeti. He also is a homelander, and the payment was good enough for his family.

In the UNHCR service, he also developed a new skill as an interpreter, as he speaks the more spoken languages and dialects from all Africa, including isXhosa and Afrikaans and all kind of Arabic dialects.

Cabby (his _"capename"_) is high and smiling, but don't take him as a _bwana_: he's clever and don't like to be mistreated.
