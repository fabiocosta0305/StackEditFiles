# Jiminy Cricket II - pt 2

## Chapter 12

> _"The_ Undying Caliphate _should not be seen as a Muslim organization as much as KKK should not be seen as a christian organization. In fact, both are the worst side in religious over-zealousness: as far KKK had gone away from Jesus's path, Peace be with Him, the_ Undying Caliphate _turned away from Allah the Most High and the Prophet's (S.A.W.) teachings as expressed in the Holy Qu'ran, by bringing_ Jihad _as a bloodsport, not as a self-purification process."_

It was a tense flight to Freetown: even seeing all the Disney shows in the entertainment system from the flights, Jiminy was worried, as he didn't knew what was expecting him at _Roque Santeiro_. The epad intel brought only matters-of-facts, things that he could discover with 5 minutes of Net-Fu, not real intel that could provide him with the _real_ situation at _Roque Santeiro_. He also knew that there was nothing he could do by now, in a flight between Amsterdam and Freetown, beside study the intel into the epad or rest, hoping his leg was better when arriving at Sierra Leone. 

The plane had touched down and he saw a known face when got out the gate: Dr. Lesley Dimantas, capename _Squirrel Girl_. 

_"Jiminy, I'll brief you while we get at_ Roque Santeiro. _We can't waste time: there's a light helicopter for us. Cabby is driving it."_ said Lesley, today using rabbit's ears and a skunk tail. An A-Class Metamorph, she was able to go _Chimera_, so she could do partial metamorphosis, and combine multiple ones to somewhat "choose" the best natural weapons she needs in any situation. Normally she just uses squirrel ears and tail, just as a kind of fashion, so Jiminy saw that she was using those parts by the powers they gave her, and this shows him she was business.

Kabba 'Cabby' Bangura was a Paragon guy: like Cajun, he didn't had a breakthrough in the strict sense of the word, but  he was a hell of a driver that could pilot anything, from a VW Beetle in the dirt roads at Sierra Leone to an helicopter to a fighter jet to a Dallara Indycar open-wheel at Indy 500. He was the local agent for HSF that supported Jiminy and others in the Derek Kwazani operation. Jiminy thought he was an incredible guy.

Jiminy got out the airport to a heliport where a helicopter was active, just waiting them. He saw two guys, that looked like Atlases under civil, while some airport crew loaded the helicopter with his things, including his clown trunk. Jiminy got into the helicopter and Lesley passing him the helicopter headset and a little box. When he opened it, there was a small Taurus 9mm pistol into a holster and two extra magazines. Jiminy looked to Lesley worried and she just shrugged.

_"Superior orders. Diana doesn't want anyone unarmed when outside_ Roque Santeiro." said Lesley, taking a submachinegun.

_"It was that bad?"_ said Jiminy, putting the holster and loading the pistol. As much he doesn't like shooting, he had training on them.

_"Had you read the intel?"_ asked Lesley, and Jiminy nodded _"They came like a storm, with many breakthroughs, looking into the refugees and kidnapping some of them and killing others. We had lots of casualties, even some of the low level breakthroughs being hurt. They also published a video at ViewTube saying a_  fatwa _against_  Roque Santeiro _and_  Herós Sans Frontières."

"Fatwa?" asked Jiminy

_"It's a document or statement about an interpretation about something under Qu'ran or Islamic law, Shar'ia's, context. Some Islamic places and populations, specially those more over zealous on Islam, takes them as law. Problem is: technically any_ mufti, shaikh _or_  iman _can issue_  fatwas. _Only his fame can say if people will look his_  fatwa _as something 'good', as far they never go against some of the pillars of the_ Islam." said Lesley, while Cabby took off from the airport.

_"So... This guy is important enough?"_ said Jiminy

_"Looks like. The_  fatwa  _wasn't signed or aligned with any of the main Islam groups,_ Sunni _or_  Shia, _but they are calling people to their cause, mainly because the clerics signataries were all linked to the_ Undying Caliphate _a way or another."_ said Lesley _"As a matter of fact, Djanni and his father read the_ fatwa _and did the translation, and they said it was a great piece of bullshit. Not in those words, of course."_

_"So, people who believe that_ fatwa _had gone and attacked_ Roque Santeiro?" asked Jiminy.

_"Yes... You need to understand that people on Islam take those_ fatwa _very seriously, according on how say it, and some people thinks that those_ Caliphate _nuts are right on scourging everyone else."_ said Cabby _"And those guys declared that_ Roque Santeiro _were full of_ Kafir, _infidels_, Shirk, _idolaters_, Zindiq, _hereticals and_ Murtadd, _apothates. So, they should be somewhat 'expurged', based on a radical violent view on Qu'ran."_

_"And they had declared_ Jihad _against_ Roque Santeiro. _Things just grew worse when they distorted the camp name origin to show us like a kind of heretical cult."_ said Lesley _"They came and took at least 50 families, and kidnapped a class of young girls. They killed some of the refugees that resisted, as they saw the_ Caliphate _ways and were against them, and they just got back when our capes decided that they should dance the Foxtrot."_ 

_"But at least 1000 people were directly or indirectly affected, and the_ Caliphate _said that it was just the beginning. Some of the analysts says the_ Caliphate _are turning his eyes to the sub-Saharan African countries as a way to regain the lost power after the War. They are getting into Mali and Guinea and other Muslim majority countries, and Sierra Leone is one of their targets. The control of the sub-Saharan Africa would provide them with resources for an all-out war against Israel. Problem is: Israel would go all-out also, and this would end badly for everyone."_ said Cabby.

_"So, what we'll do?"_ said Jiminy

_"First of all, the Camp is on Code Red: until we rebuild the lost infra and equipments, no one get in or out without Diana and the other big guys knows. Everyone in Cape until further order, and rebuild the camp is priority Alpha. Your team is already deployed, Jiminy, they got yesterday on the field. As soon we arrive, you have order to put your costume and go for Dispatch. Soldaire said to you be always armed, either with the Cricket pistols, the Tesla Arc Gloves and the Jiminy Cane. Dumont had corrected the glove project and put some batteries for them in the common Costume."_ said Lesley _"I myself will get for the perimeter: I can turn myself into a meerkat or a orangutan if needed."_

_"Sierra Leone is also under an Alpha situation: the_ Caliphate _had expelled some people and pushed them out of their homes, including Nondaba's village."_ said Cabby

_"What?"_ said Jiminy. The Nondaba village was the place where Jiminy lived some of the most important and difficult experiences in his life, when a fight between Josephine Nondaba, capename _Kilimanjaro_ and his team almost resulted in him going crazy when his _Bellax Analytica_ gone haywire, and where he saw a kid, Senesie, undergone a drug-induced psychotic breakthrough. His actions and his team's were crucial to the kid survival and recovery. Now he was a B-Class Merlin developing healing powers.

_"The Nondabas are animistics, so for radical Muslims this turns them into_ Shirk. _So, they attacked the village, and expelled them. Both Kilimanjaro's mother and grandmother had died in the process."_ said Cabby.  Jiminy felt a pain in his heart: he remembered them, Masseray and Mabinty, caring him when he was crazy on the _Bellax Analytica_ oversurge that haywired his mind into a multiple grim potential futures nightmare. They were very old and wise, like those sage woman from the fairy tales. Jiminy would always remember Mabinty looking to him and talking he had a kind face below the cricket mask.

_"Where they are... I mean, their bodies, they were buried?"_ said Jiminy

_"No: the Nondabas cremates the dead. I think Kilimanjaro is holding their ashes."_ said Cabby, when Jiminy saw the _Roque Santeiro_ camp.

_"I would like to show my respects before getting in the field."_ said Jiminy.

_"Alright, but we need you to be fast."_ said Lesley, while Cabby touched the _Roque Santeiro_ heliport _"We need you ASAP in the Dispatch."_

---

Just half an hour after, Jiminy was in Dispatch, already back into his costume, even there armed with their Cricket pistols, energy pistols made on the _SolPistols_ design by Doctor Shokichi Hisagawa, the Verne that developed the _SolArmor_ Soldaire was donning in the field now that Jiminy freed him from the Dispatch work. In his gloves, two small circles showed the (now deactivated to avoid problems) _Tesla Arc Gloves_, energy weapons based on the Demoiselle's _Tesla Arc Cannon_, made by Dumont. Jiminy just took a rapid shower, put his costume and gone for give his condolences to Kilimanjaro and do a little prayer for Mabinty and Masseray's souls.

_"Jiminy, had you saw the_ fatwa _text?"_ said Diana

_"No... It wasn't in the epad HSF gave me at NY, and Lesley didn't show me the contents."_ said Jiminy 

_"I'll pass you it, and as things are a little calmer now, you should take your time and read it. Mrs. Zahan translated it and commented it under the justifications they used into the_ Qu'ran _for our allies in the Islamic States, like Guinea and Sierra Leone."_ said Diana, sending him a file via Dispatch system to his station _"Need to say, this is classified intel: LDS had not made a official statement on this one, and so this was the reason it wasn't into the epad at NY. Obviously people are finding this on the Internet, but officially we still treat this as classified intel."_

Jiminy just took five minutes to read, and two to get out from the flabbergasted state he gone.

He almost expelled some bad words!

_"What a pile of..."_ said Jiminy

_"I know, but it was done for their public. They are doing all they could to make people goes radicalized after what happened with the_ Caliphate War _and_ Eretz Israel. _For them,_ Roque Santeiro, _by promoting integration and helping the refugees under HSF and MSF organizations, are part of the so called_  Crusader Forces _from LDS. They summarily ignores that_ Red Crescent, _the Muslim arm of Red Cross is through and through with us! We are and we'll never be associated to any side in a conflict: our side is the refugee side. To be bluntly frank, as long they doesn't mess with people, LDS and the Caliphate could nuke themselves into oblivion. But the Caliphate is working the same rhetorics every totalitarian regimen did in the past."_ said Diana

_"And now?"_ said Jiminy

_"We are even with a bigger problem: LDS is calling back their troops, and we'll be at minimal forces from them. UNHCR will reinforce the Blue Berets, but we needed to call almost all the Situation 2 teams from HSF."_ said Diana _"And the big kahunas at HSF doesn't like this. To be fair, you were the last team 'in bench', and we are just praying for no Omega Events happens, or things will go really Foxtrot!"_ said Diana, and Jiminy could see, by her voice in the Dispatch comm, that looked like she was really tired.

_"Are you okay, Diana?"_ asked Jiminy

_"Just tired..."_ said Diana _"Hadn't too much sleep since the Attack: just 8 hours in 72."_ said Diana

_"If you want to go sleep, I assume the Dispatch fully!"_ said Jiminy

_"Kid, it's a big of a bite for you..."_ said Diana _"But... Let us do this way: Colonel Carlos will assume Dispatch for the Berets, and you'll help him by taking HSF teams at Dispatch, okay? Really need to take a sleep."_ said Diana

_"Okay!"_ said Jiminy and another voice, that he saw as Colonel Carlos, that he knew during the previous tour at _Roque Santeiro_.

_"Good. Carlos, Jiminy, Dispatch is yours, remembering we are at_ Code Red, Alpha _Situation. Any serious event, wake me up. I'll be here in my room."_ said Diana

_"Roger!"_ both said

Jiminy was very useful, by coordinating the cape teams to rebuild the local infrastructure and defense lines. He was doing the best for his job when one of the Intel guys called him.

_"Jiminy Cricket, Corporal McDaggert, Irish Army, sir!"_ said him, via the Dispatch video-conference system. He wasn't on the same room, but into a big barrack with a big, green-white-orange flag at his back. _"We received from our guys that monitores the Deep Web a video that sounds like_ Caliphate _propaganda. One of them felt strange after seeing the video and send me it. Could you look for it?"_ 

_"Right. Colonel Carlos, Dispatch is all yours for some minutes, okay?"_ said Jiminy

_"Roger!"_ said Colonel Carlos while Jiminy received the video via a secure, Asimov-encrypted link.

The video started with a kind of ethnical fanfare, and many things written in Arabic. Some of them he understood from the basics Djanni teached him while he was casted after the Kwazani operation. Things like _Crusaders_, and _Pigs_ and _Heretics_ where showed in the screen. Then he activated the subtitles and noted that the Irish guys did a good job on translating this thing. There was a little man into a turban and traditional Arabic clothes that started to talk.

_"We had success into getting in the Crusader's hideout called_ Roque Santeiro. _We freed some of our brothers and took 50 girls to provide us new soldiers,_ Mujaheddin _for Allah the Most High, to smite the unbelievers and bring them the words of Muhammad the Prophet (S.A.W). But there'll be even more. We'll take all our brothers from the world to take arms in the_ Holy Jihad _against the  Crusaders and to free our brothers in the sub-Saharan countries, to unify the followers of The Only God Allah and shows the world he's the Only One. I thereby urge, in name of the Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful, to all the Muslim, all the brothers part of the_ Ummah _around the world to act against the Crusaders and join us in the_ Holy Jihad _to show the infidels that Allah is the One, and that the_ Mahdi _is coming to cleanse the world from the evil!"_

Jiminy had to shield himself mentally as he noted a kind of compulsion trying to get into his mind, specially in the last part of it.

_"Someone else had saw this one, Corporal McDaggert?"_ said Jiminy

_"Our translators and some of the intel guys."_ said McDaggert.

_"If you can, quarantine then for a day or two. Take some excuse to see how they are discreetly. This video is laced with some kind of mind-bending compulsion. I think this guy is an unknown Mastermind breakthrough like myself. I felt like he was trying to put me under his will, and the tone he used looked similar of my_ Pretty Please! _power."_ said Jiminy.

_"Alright, I'll do as you said."_ said Corporal McDaggert. _"We'll try to find some intel about this guy. Looks like he's under the radar by some time."_

_"Okay."_ said Jiminy _"I'll show this for Diana and Lesley as soon as possible. By now, asks also the Asimov guys to do their best and block this. I don't know which could happen if this was saw here."_ 

_"Roger, we'll do it ASAP. Out."_ said the Corporal McDaggert disconnecting from the video chat.

Jiminy made a copy of this file into an special flash drive he have, that used Vernetech and Asimov encryption to avoid being used by others, his own DNA and brain waves acting as key to encrypt the files. A very new Vernetech trick, but useful.

_"Had you heard our talk, Colonel Carlos?"_ said Jiminy

_"Yeah. Didn't saw this video, but looks like something dangerous. This guy is that powerful?"_ said Carlos

_"Looks like: Masterminds that have will-bending powers like me and him have some kind of restrictions. As you know, I can't use_ Pretty Please! _to make someone go mean or violent. Looks like this guy have not this restriction. Maybe the message was weak on me as I'm not a Muslim..."_ said Jiminy _"Maybe I'll try this with Djanni, albeit this would be risky."_

_"Do you think that this power using could be more effective against Muslims?"_ sound Carlos

_"Maybe... I don't know, however, if it's his power or just his rhetoric... I'll need to see more about this. I made a copy of this one on my special flash drive as evidence if needed."_ said Jiminy _"I had took a snapshot on the guy, maybe we should work with all the intelligence people for him."_

_"Send me this, I'll send for LDS and UN people to work with surveillance people for extra intel."_ said Colonel Carlos, while Jiminy send the image.

_"Right. Let us focus on the job and then get some rest when the shift goes."_ said Jiminy

---

_"So, you received that video?"_ said Diana

_"The Irish intelligence guys took it from the Deep Web. Looks like it was laced with some kind of will-bending suggestion, like my_ Pretty Please! _I felt it, but not strongly."_ said Jiminy, when everyone was together at the meeting room _"I need to say, Djanni, that looks like this guy is trying to radicalize Muslims, and not only by rhetorics: looks like he has a kind of will-bending power like mine."_

_"Could you test this?"_ said Soldaire

_"This is the problem: my theory is that his_ Pretty Please!_-like power is focused on people on the same faith than himself. So, the only way to test it is to see the Muslim reaction under this video."_ said Jiminy _"But I would not do this with you, Djanni, if you doesn't want, because I don't know how strong his will-bending compulsion would be. In fact,_ I _felt myself worryingly susceptible to get into his compulsion, and I'm originally a non-follower Catholic and a cape that knows how his power works, this should make me immune."_

_"I have no problem to do this."_ said Djanni _"I've been well educated in the Qu'ran. I could see the_ haram _very fast. And we need to stop this guy perversion on the Prophet's words (S.A.W.). Those guys and that_ fatwa _were in the same kind, and I passed through it... I think I can deal with this."_

_"Okay."_ said Dumont. _"But Kuntur and LionHeart will be nearby you to contain you if needed. We can't be naive enough to believe that they could not force you. Also, Jiminy, I want you to be ready to_ Pretty Please! _him as strongly as you can if needed."_

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy, when he put the flash-drive and showed everyone the video into the meeting room screen.

While everyone looked to this one, as flabbergasted them he was, Jiminy looked for Djanni, and he saw his face growing angry and angry, until...

He punched the screen with all he could, his face into a strong rage, smashing the TV into smithereens, scraps of it all around the room:

_"Shut the f--k up, you_ murtadd!!!!", screamed Djanni, _"You_ Zindiq!"

"Pretty Please, _Djanni, calm down yourself!"_ asked Jiminy, and Djanni got back his own feet, trembling.

_"Are you okay, Djanni?"_ said Sugarplum

_"No... It was... Evil! It's_ haram! Haram! Haram! _What this guy is doing is_ haram!" said Djanni _"I just didn't felt under his poisoned honey words because Ozma and Chakra tricks!"_

When in _Metrocon_, all the _Herós Sans Frontières_ team gave and saw some lectures from other teams. One of those letters, given by _Chakra_ and _Ozma_, was about psychic invasion, suggestions and hypnotic trances, on how detect and avoid them. The trick was each one have something that could say or sing mentally if they suspect someone was trying to put them into hypnotic suggestion or invasion. For Jiminy was the musics _When you wish upon a star_ and _Give a little whistle_, from _Pinocchio_, and for Djanni was reciting all the 99 names of Allah and the _Shadahah_, the testimony of _"That there is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God."_. 

To be so strong that, even using Chakra's tricks, Djanni almost felt into that hypnosis, this guy would be really strong into his will-bending power.

_"That's okay, Djanni! You're now with friends._ Pretty Please, _get calm again."_ said Jiminy, thinking he was needing another _Pretty Please!_ to get back to his normal stance.

Djanni got back to his calm, albeit he was shaken.

_"This guy is using the_ Allah'_s gift of power, the breakthrough, to bind the will of others. I could hear he asking me to hate, to hate everyone and everything that was impure under Allah, everyone that wasn't part of the_ Ummah! _To kill the_ Kafir, Shirk, Zindiq, murtadd! _He uses the idea of the_ Mahdi _as a way to justify himself. He treats himself as the_ Mahdi!" said Djanni, shaken, crying while talking _"He's taking himself as someone as powerful as The Prophet (S.A.W.)! And I_ almost _fell under his sweet poisoned words!"_

_"Easy, Djanni!"_ said Dumont, while Jiminy was going to give him a little hug.

_"Yeah! It's not your fault! Jiminy was right!"_ said Sugarplum _"Looks like this guy is a_ Mastermind _like Jiminy. Jiminy, how strong he is, in your opinion?"_ 

Normally, heroes with the same set of powers can somehow avail each other based on their own relative strength. So, Ajaxes avail themselves, like Atlases or, in Jiminy Cricket case, Masterminds. With training, a good breakthrough, or even a common person, is able to do a somewhat precise power grading, but the best ratings are done by those with the same power set.

_"B-Class at least... I think that he can even be an_ Ultra _based on Djanni's reaction, but I hope I'm wrong. I could say that we should take him as A-Class like me, but considering the possibility of an_ Ultra, _but fortunately not an_ Omega." said Jiminy, saying, looking over Djanni's shoulder, that needed a friend's hug _"The biggest problem is that his_ Do as I said _power is less limited."_

"Do as I said?" asked Diana

_"All the variants of will-bending powers Masterminds have are considered a single power at_ Barlow's, _called_ Do as I said." said Jiminy _"My own is called_ Pretty Please! _because this is one of my restrictions: I need to use the words_ Pretty Please _before my power engage. This is important: all the_ Do as I said _powers have a kind or another of restriction, limitation, trigger or setback. Normally a group of them, and one of the ways to know how much someone is powerful is based on how much or less of them he has: the less he has, the more powerful. I suspect that this guy doesn't have a trigger word, like me. Maybe I'll try to see this after again to determine better. Djanni, now I need you to remember what you felt while hearing his discourse."_ said Jiminy _"This will help us to understand how this guy's powers works."_

_"Alright!"_ said Djanni, breathing, trying to focus his mind _"I felt him talking with some power, and I could heard something in the back. I can't say if this was subliminal or it was my mind playing tricks with me, but he started to scream_ 'Jihad, Jihad, Jihad!' _all the time, and also_ Kafir, Shirk, Zindiq, murtadd. _This was making me hating everyone non_-Ummah, _non-Muslim, around me. And, when I almost felt into his power, ready to bring death to infidels... I felt myself getting back when I gone into the_ Shadahah, _and noted that he was tricking with my mind. And... I feel myself dirty!"_ said Djanni _"Almost attacked you all. I could had killed you, Jiminy, and Sugarplum and Dumont and Soldaire. You were the main targets in my mind when in rage against infidels..."_ he said, crying.

_"It's okay, Djanni. You were out of yourself. I'm sorry."_ said Jiminy, starting to cry together _"It would be my fault if you gone a killer."_

_"No, Jiminy... It's..."_ tried to say Djanni

_"It's no one here fault."_ said Sugarplum _"Those kind of hate guy is the worst kind of moron you could see. Those guys of the_ Undying Caliphate, Humanity First, Paladins, NAWB... _All of them, they are the worst kind of creepypasta, because there's no talk with them: they took Law of retaliation,_ Lex Talionis, _to their heart. They're the worst. Eye by eye, the world will be blind."_

_"Mahatma Gandhi."_ said LionHeart _"This is like those gang guys from the Bronx. They looked_ Bronx Shoulder _as a weapon to cleanse the neighborhood from cops and so."_

_"Like those Pure God Work Fraternity."_ said Jiminy

_"At least,"_ said Diana _"you helped us, Djanni. What could you say, Jiminy?"_ 

_"His power is B-Class at least. Sounds like a kind of psychotic breakthrough, because he can induce hate on others via his Mastermind power_ Do as you Said..."

_"Call them_ Sword Verse. _I heard them into my mind."_ said Djanni

"Sword verse?" said Jiminy.

"'Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them captive, and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful!' _It's the fifth verse of the ninth sura of the Holy Qu'ran. Those who are against the Qu'ran says this is a declaration of war against infidels, considering the first part, about sieges, slaying and ambushes... But the next verse is more important, and is all about how my powers will be always be used:_ 'if any of the idolaters seeks of thee protection, grant him protection till he hears the words of God; then do thou convey him to his place of security -- that, because they are a people who do not know.' _We are not here to be judges, but helpers, for glory of Allah the Forgiving and Merciful._" said Djanni _"And I think this guy is just looking on the first part of the_ Sword Verse."

_"So,"_ said Dumont _"Sounds as appropriate to call it this way."_

_"Okay..."_ said Jiminy _"So, the now named_ Sword Verse _can induce hate in people, and affects even more Muslims, as it is focused on them. Looks he has no kind of trigger words, like my_ Pretty Please!, _so we need to be cautious when dealing with this guy videos. Any video from this guy can be laced with his powers: without a trigger word, only a Mastermind could detect it."_

_"Looks coherent, as the original post-Event_ Caliphate _was formed by a guy, Armagan Acar, that sounds like was an Ultra Mastermind. Maybe they somehow were able to recreate those powers, or another Mastermind took his place. This guy could be the one we were trying to find."_ said Diana

_"So, we'll need to deal with this creepypasta?"_ said Sugarplum

_"And soon: LDS and Israel patience is growing small. Some people said that_ Mossad _is already mapping POI targets for nuclear action... And don't say me 'they don't have nukes': it's an open secret that Israel is a nuclear power. Some conspiration theorist even thinks that Israel had nuked himself Tel Aviv to justify an action against the West Bank and Gaza. I don't believe it, but for the ones that associates Israel with ethnical cleansing, this all make sense: they would only need an excuse to restore_ Eretz Israel _and the_ Caliphate _gave it. There's no saints in politics."_

_"But how we'll find this guy?"_ said Jiminy

They all heard a siren and the Earbug of all of them ringing. 

_"We have a Code Red situation!"_ said Dispatch _"There's some tangos coming!"_

_"What?"_ said Diana

## Chapter 13

> _"Two attacks in less then a week: those guys were persistent, and we are in extreme situation. And in extreme situations, real heroic acts happens."_

Everyone got into their positions. The new improvement in _SolArmor_, called _Gen3_, have a bigger using time, coming for two hours, although it was really risky, and Soldaire donned it as soon they got out the meeting room.

_"Djanni, stay nearby Dispatch!"_ said Soldaire _"Jiminy, on Dispatch. Cajun, out the bench and near Djanni. Sugarplum, Dumont and Kuntur, fly now. Hufflepuff and LionHeart, on me. Everyone armed and ready. Looks like they want to bring the Foxtrot, so they'll dance it!"_

_"Everyone in your positions. Lesley, Corin and Cabby, I want you in the near the Dispatch. Lesley, support on medical teams. Corin, deal with internal security. Cabby, any emergency, you engage the evacuation protocols. I'm going to the field. Carlos, Jiminy, Dispatch is all yours. Situation is a go!"_ said Diana.

_"Jiminy, let me stay with you... I'm not that confident that I was not manipulated."_ said Djanni.

_"Okay, Djanni..._ Pretty Please, _stay with Cajun. Cajun, if you think there's anything weird with Djanni, call me ASAP. But I believe he's not a weak one to get into this guy poisoned words."_ said Jiminy, entering Dispatch

"Oui, Jiminy Criquet!" said Cajun.

Jiminy took away the Top Hat and put the headset and hitted his login information. _"Diana, are you going for field?"_ said Jiminy when he looked for Diana information.

_"Yeah! Those guys brought the Foxtrot again and this pisses me off. They want to dance the samba? Hope they have hips for this!"_ she said, and by the tone Diana looked business.

_"Joshua, there's a Deep Web live-streaming this thing! And looked like in somewhere else is that guy. What should we do?"_ said a Jovert Pienaar, from South African National Defense Force.

_"Put our Asimovs to try and find this guy IP... No matter where, he needed to enter somewhere in the Internet to get into Deep Web. Track him out. We'll need to take the chance and try to find him."_ said Jiminy _"For now, block the IP access for the site, NOW!"_ said Joshua.

_"We're working on it, but looks like there's no way beside a total shutdown."_ said Jovert.

_"Forget it so: internal security, be ready for a Code Red, even a Charlie Foxtrot."_ said Jiminy, while seeing the screens in front of him _"Soldaire, Jiminy on Dispatch: looks they have a big army before you."_

_"You don't say!"_ said Soldaire, trying to reduce the grim situation with a joke. Jiminy knows why: he fears Jiminy's _Bellax Analytica_ could go haywire again and make him useless.

_"Alright, let us see our actual situation!"_ said Jiminy _"They are bigger than us 10 per 1, and they have 4 breakthroughs per 1 of ours, mainly Ajaxes, but you can think on them having all the kind of powers. Also... They are live-streaming all this on Deep Web."_

_"What? Jiminy, you can..."_ said Diana

_"Cut this? Yes... But we need to find that guy, and so, it's better to take a risk and find him, putting our Asimovs to search the Deep Web for the streamer."_ said Jiminy

_"Okay, hope you're okay."_ said Diana _"Those guys are coming for the barnstormer dance."_

_"They are bringing the Foxtrot. So we'll make them dance!"_ said Jiminy. _"Let's go!"_

They got in front, Soldaire, Hufflepuff, LionHeart and Kuntur at the ground, Dumont and Sugarplum at the air, Sugarplum as a Tink: she's faster in this mode, and she could go and ward almost everyone in Roque Santeiro in moments.

_"Jiminy, what about changing the weather?"_ said Sugarplum

_"No! They have their own Merlins for sure! Better to use the weather control as aggressive as you can. Think you ready some tricks before."_ said Jiminy

_"Yeah! Ozma said me we need to be as prepared as possible."_ said Sugarplum _"Have already some ideas."_ 

_"Okay!"_ Jiminy said _"Dumont, Sugarplum, let us give them our greet!"_ 

_"All the troops! Lock and Load! Let us make them dance the Foxtrot!"_ said Carlos.

_"Dumont, I'll need you in the sniper."_ said Jiminy, when the first guys were at fire range _"Fire!!"_

_"Alright! Tesla Shot Barrage!"_ said Dumont.

Lots of small needles, made of a kind of Vernetech aluminum alloy, got from behind Demoiselle and gone to the targets hitting many of them straight, some energy pulses being saw: the electromagnetic pulse doing a powerful recoy and making them gone unconscious and in pain. 

_"Good one, Dumont!"_ said Jiminy _"That cleared some of the tangos!"_

_"Now is with us,_ Pepito Grillo!" said Hufflepuff _"It's time for_ LUCHA!" he screamed, running to the biggest tango he could, grappling them into instants.

_"Now it's time for justice! Twenty-first Century Police Force... SOLDAIRE!"_ said Soldaire, doing a flamboyant pose before engaging fight.

LionHeart and Kuntur just shrugged and engaged the target nearby.

_"Now!"_ said Sugarplum. She recited some thing and pointed a special wand made of holly she prepared recently to a point in the middle of the tangos, and a ball of yellow lighting gone to the ground, working like a kind of gigantic concussion grenade, disabling lots of the tangos.

_"Great, Sugarplum!"_ said Jiminy _"Good news: almost no more common tangos on your range, Diana. Bad news: the breakthrough tangos are trying to flank you!"_ he said, looking for the ghost-future images from his _Bellax Analytica_ overlapping his own present time.

_"Got it!"_ said Sugarplum. She took from somewhere in the pockets of her petticoats and released what looked like a little acorn, that fell and grow to the size of an acorn. This made a kind of ward, protect them. The brick had worked into a way for it and lots of the weaker ones were felt.

_"How many,_ Pepito Grillo?" said Kuntur, after throwing a tango Atlas against other tangos

_"Not too much, but things will grew worse: the rabble already fell, but they are still 3 per 1 and at least B-Classes!"_ said Jiminy, when they heard something via the Earbug.

The _Shadahah_ being played into a recognized way.

_"Jiminy, I'm not well!"_ said Djanni, desperate _"I feel that hate voice growing on myself!"_

Jiminy shouted strongly.

_"Everyone, prepares for a Charlie Foxtrot, a big one!"_ said Jiminy _"What about that location, Sargent Pienaar?"_

_"Found a potential place!"_ said the South African intel man _"But they are doing countermeasures: looks like they have their own Asimovs!"_

_"Get out!"_ said Jiminy "Code Red _situation: blackout on outside comms! Only Earbug!"_

"Jiminy Criquet, _Djanni is going crazy!"_ said Cajun

_"Blacklocks on him, bring him here! Corin, give Cajun help!"_ said Jiminy

_"What is happening?"_ said Diana

_"I know: I'm feeling in... Post-Hypnotic Suggestion! The_ Sword Verse _is a very strong power!"_ said Jiminy, feeling even  more worry as he was into a fight in two fronts, his _Bellax Analytica_ splitting and multiplying and dangerous growing more and more difficult to control.

_"Jiminy, I'll take the battle!"_ said Carlos, seeing Jiminy's uneasiness _"Focus on the_ Code Red!"

_"Alright!"_ said Jiminy, getting out the station and running to Djanni

_"He's growing crazy!"_ said Corin. Cajun and Djanni's parents were nearby. Djanni was screaming in pain and hate.

"Pretty Please, _Djanni! This is not you! This is a crazy guy that believes himself the_ Mahdi" said Jiminy.

Djanni was screaming: _"Murtadd! Murtadd! Haram! Haram! Kafir! Shirk! Zindiq! Murtadd!"_ and looking in rage.

It was when Jiminy looked for him and, crying, slapped Djanni's face: "PRETTY PLEASE, _STOP IT!!!"_

Djanni looked for Jiminy furious, and tried to advance for him, but it was when someone else slapped him.

It was his father.

_"Stop it! In the name of the Compassionate, the Merciful, the Forgiving, Allah the Most High! No matter what others says: we were never a warmongering faith!"_ said Zayn Tahan _"And if the Most High gave you the power of being stronger than the lion, you should also be peaceful as the sheep!"_

Djanni fell crying, but Jiminy noted he was back to his best.

_"Cabby, engage evacuation protocol, but held the run. Corin, take Dispatch in my place. Lesley, help medical support, look like we'll need them. Djanni,_ Pretty Please, _help me! I need you as much now as possible! Remember Ozma and Chakra's tips! I need you to get over this mental control! This guy is trying to take you to their murderous forces."_ said Jiminy

_"Son, hear Jiminy Cricket. No matter what this hate guy says, no matter Jiminy being an Infidel, Jiminy is more with Allah the Most High than him. He helped you and was with you and with us. He's your friend beyond all, and he never took you as a terrorist, as you never took him as a Crusader. Now, son, take away those burden from his mind."_ said Mr. Tahan.

Djanni felt over his knees and said, still crying, before going into his feet. _"Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful!"_ saying. _"Sorry about all this..."_ was saying, when Jiminy, almost crying, said

_"Let us do what we need and we'll cry together later."_ said Jiminy, cleaning his own tears, while Djanni done the same with his, when they heard Corin at the Earbug _"We have rioters all around! Some of them took the radio station! Looks like they were sleeper agents!"_

_"They will use it to play a_ Sword Verse-_laced record to radicalize people!"_ said Djanni

_"Let's go!"_ said Jiminy, showing a hook getting out his costume's collar, part of the harnesses he uses in the costume as a way to be flown away by the fliers from the team.

_"Let me go with you!"_ said Squirrel Girl, turning herself into a small meerkat and getting into one of the big pockets front Jiminy's tails.

One of the recent modifications in his costume made by Dumont included a new hook into his costume that Djanni could use to take and lift Jiminy, bring Jiminy to the skies with him.

_"Gave us the fast route to the station, quick!"_ said Jiminy

_"Alright!"_ said Corin _"Sending you! The Berets can't hold too much! We can't open fire, but they want to pass over, even by killing the Berets! This can grow into a bloodbath"_ 

They flew very fast, Jiminy holding his hat and eyes close to avoid problems, when he saw four guys, all of them looking like refugees, with knives and clubs, and the Berets were not able to stop them. Squirrel Girl dropped from Jiminy's pocket, changing from a meerkat to a skunk.

_"Alright, Djanni, let get down! We need to stop them!"_ said Jiminy _"Don't abuse on strength, but go all out with speed!"_

_"Roger!"_ said Djanni, looking a little better and more focused.

When Jiminy and Djanni dropped, Squirrel Girl already sprayed the front guys with her skunk perfume, and  Jiminy used his Jiminy cane to avoid  the tangos' attacks and attacking them with his _Jiminy Cane_ in the Taser mode, knocking two of the attackers out. One of them tried to run into the radio, but Djanni put itself between him and the door, and punched him straight in the belly, making him gasp and get down, unconscious.

The last one, unfortunately, got inside, running to the controls. Jiminy used his _Jiminy Cane_ and shoot him straight into his hand, which made him yelp, while Squirrel Girl got and sprayed also him. Djanni got nearby when Jiminy looked his _Bellax Analytica_!

_"Suicide Bomber!"_ said Jiminy, and he jumped, ignoring Squirrel Girl's skunk perfume, hitting his _Jiminy Cane_ straight in his right hand, before the man could activate the explosives. Then, he attacked the man with the Taser in maximum strength, hitting him in the hand and making him feel the spasms on all his body, the lethal contacts from the bomb away from each other.

Djanni looked and said: _"Wow... Jiminy, you saved our lives!"_ 

Jiminy got in a corner, almost trembling, when the Berets came and removed the guy carefully.

_"Things are still escalating!"_ said Corin in the Dispatch _"We need to stop this craziness!"_

_"But how?"_ said Jiminy, exhausted

Djanni looked for him

_"We'll do what they want, but quite the contrary!"_ said Djanni

_"What?!"_ said Jiminy

_"Let us send some message of peace, lacing it with your_ Pretty Please! _C'mon Jiminy, I lost the account on how much I saw you doing this!"_ said Djanni

_"I don't know if I could this... Never tried to do this using radio transmission!"_ said Jiminy

_"If that guy can do the_ Sword Verse _this way, you can do the_ Pretty Please. _I saw you doing this using megaphones, FM radio is more or less the same."_ said Djanni

_"Alright, but I need the words:_ Pretty Please _will not work in this case. That guy power is focused on provoking hate based on the creed. I could no more stop everyone here to fight his power more than I could stop_ Humanity First _to put my house down!"_ said Jiminy, crying, feeling the pressure.

Djanni came and look to him, serious.

_"Look at me: I'm of the_ Ummah! _I can do the words. I need you to use your powers to pass those words through him, convincing them we are right. We can't be defeated by this guy, he's only one delusional guy. We're two, and Allah the Most High, the Compassionated, Forgiving and Merciful One will be with us."_ said Djanni, taking a little green book from the pocket of his Simbad-like waistcoat. Jiminy knows it was the _Holy Qu'ran_. _"We'll show them what_ Jihad _really is!"_ he said, taking a little notepad and pen and starting to write his own message, while Jiminy and Squirrel Girl turned on all the FM instruments.

_"Jiminy, Soldaire here! We've pushed them out, but still have the local_ Code Red _situation. If you can do something, for all that is Sacred, do it NOW! We are with problems to do the crowd control! This will go very fast into a for-real riot!"_ said Soldaire

Djanni finished to scribe the note, and then Joshua took it and sat down in the speaker position, locking himself into the sound proof room, while Djanni and Squirrel Girl, back into his human body, except using rabbit ears and haunched legs and skunk's tail, got to the sound table. Jiminy breathed longly, putting himself as calm as he could, and Djanni did a countdown with his fingers beyond the soundproof room, and a light with _ON_ on it lighted up.

_"Everyone hearing this now,_ Pretty Please, _stop the fight!"_ started Jiminy, knowing that his powers depends on the voice and tone and words, adjusting those correctly _"You are being misleading. You're being used by someone with ambitions that is against the_ Ummah, _the People of Islam. In the sixth verse of the ninth sura, Mohammad the Prophet (S.A.W) said:_ 'if any of the idolaters seeks of thee protection, grant him protection till he hears the words of God; then do thou convey him to his place of security -- that, because they are a people who do not know.' _You are all in the same place: you were forgotten by people that ignored Allah the Most High, Mohammad the Prophet (S.A.W), and Jesus, or Isa, Peace Be with Him. They are the ultimate idolaters. They are the ultimate unbelievers, because they know, but they doesn't follow. They are the ultimate aposthaste, because they know, but distorts the High One's words, revealed to the Prophet (S.A.W.) by Gibril. They treat you like dirt. Stop your fight now and hear the words of Allah the Most High, as revealed by Mohammad the Prophet (S.A.W)"_ said Jiminy, while he started to say the quotes from the Qu'ran chosen by Djanni.

_"Incredible!"_ said Cabby, looking to the people around stopping the fight.

"Sacre Bleu!" said Cajun via the Earbug _"You're doing a miracle, you two!"_

_"Dispatch! Here's security! There's almost no more fight!"_ said someone _"Some fight focuses, but the lion's share just stopped, and the one staying in the fight being well-known troublemakers."_

_"They are getting away! We're doing it!"_ said Djanni

Jiminy thought that this was not enough.

_"Now,"_ said Jiminy _"This is the words from Isa, Peace be with him, Jesus, as said by Him into the Mount of Galilee."_ Djanni looked a little surprised, but Jiminy started _"This is me, Jiminy Cricket, for everyone in_ Roque Santeiro, _saying that hate should not have space here. We're all suffering, we're all in the same boat, no matter each one's origin or creed."_

_"Blessed are the meek: for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful: for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they will be called children of God."_ said Jiminy Cricket, calm and suave.

_"Jiminy, Corin here! They stopped! Almost no one is fighting now! They're stopping!"_ said Corin via Earbug, which made them cry.

_"Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful!"_ said Djanni _"We did it! We did it! We stopped the_ Sword Verse!"

They looked to Jiminy, but he looked not well, almost falling in the chair

_"Jiminy?"_ said Djanni

_"Just... Exhausted... Need to... Rest."_ said Jiminy, trying to get out the chair, but almost falling when trying to stand on his own feet.

Squirrel Girl turned back to his normal squirrelly girl fashion and said: _"Now, Jiminy, rest a little!"_

_"No time for..."_ said Jiminy, trying to get over his feet.

_"Jiminy, here's Dispatch. The tangos retreated. We have some casualties, but no kills under our side. LionHeart had the worst, but he's just with a dislocated arm, not too much for an Ajax."_

_"Now, Jiminy. Take some sleep. You and Djanni did very well."_ said Diana

_"And we have some intel about this guy!"_ said Corporal McDaggert _"The Asimov guys did their drill in the meantime and took some intel about them. The tangos disconnected and maybe will try to move away, but we had them locked into target!"_

Jiminy gave a little smile and nodded off, Squirrel Girl carrying him, her tail as a pillow for him, while they got out of the radio.

## Chapter 14

> _"One the things I like the most in our_ CAI _teams at_ Herós Sans Frontières _is: we have people from all origins. In fact, my team basically is a mishmash of people from all around the world: a Brazilian Dandy, a convicted under parole from Bronx, a ballerina from North Carolina, a Japanese super-armored hero, a_ Tecnico Luchador _from Mexico, a flying condor from Bolivia, a flamboyant swordman from Quebec, and two kids, a Tunisian Refugee and the messy Mastermind from Newark that wrote those words. Mixing so much kinds of breakthroughs, powers, skills, and origins, we could do things that others couldn't. As we did in the aftermath of the_ Sword Verse _attacks."_
>
>  **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

_"So..."_ said Jiminy

_"People are still into a terrible mood."_ said Diana _"Two attacks in less than a week... There's lots of people going to other refugee camps, like Dadaab or Kakuma, feeling that Roque Santeiro is not safe anymore, and I can't blame them. They fear that those post-hypnotic thing from_ Sword Verse _could get back: even the Muslims are fearing to do the wrong prayer and trigger other post-hypnotic triggers and gone amok trying to kill people, even on their own."_

_"Understand..."_ said Jiminy _"So, you want me to do some job with the_ Clowns Without Borders _guys."_

_"Yeah!"_ said Diana _"I think that we can use this to do some surveillance: as far I understood,_ Pretty Please! _and_ Sword Verse _are similar powers, that_ Do as I said _thing. So, I think you can detect those that could be under a post-hypnotic trance, or at least those that could react weird against your_ Pretty Please! _, and if you go as_ Spotty the Clown _you could take them unguarded. They would get themselves guarded against a cape like_ Jiminy Cricket, _but a little clown like_ Spotty _could be seen as inoffensive and so people could go mentally unguarded, even those with the triggers. Besides, after all that, I think that everyone needs a laugh. We don't need Boggarts or Dementors here, and we don't have a werewolf Defense Against Dark Arts teacher to help, so we'll do this with a little clown."_ she said, smiling

Jiminy smiled... He though on who could do this and who could help him, besides the _Clown Without Borders_ guys.

He then had gone for his team and Sugarplum, Dumont and LionHeart proposed to help him on other things: Dumont said he could mount some limelights, while Sugarplum could use some little magic sprinkles to make everything more beautiful and LionHeart could go for some juggling show or other things, when Hufflepuff said him to do a makeshift _lucha_ show: everyone knows that some of _lucha_ fights are scened, but there was always _Kayfabe_, or _La Passion por La Lucha_ as he said. By doing this, Hufflepuff could use the old supervillain LionHeart alter-ego, _The Bronx Shoulder_ and do something nice and fun. As a convicted, LionHeart would not have a _secret identity_, but a _private_ one.

As clown partner for _Spotty_ in the skits, Djanni accepted the role. Mrs. Tahan made his clown costume, as the Tahans and McCarthys got back for Geneva for security after the second attack against _Roque Santeiro_. She would send him from Geneva in the next cargo freight for _Roque Santeiro_, while he would share some of the spare makeup Jiminy brought from the clown school. To avoid problems with language, they would adapt some of the skits, or do physical comedy skits.

_"But which ones we could do?"_ said Djanni

_"We can see some skits at ViewTube and see if they are funny. We can also look the skit book I gained at clown school."_ said Jiminy, opening the book and his notebook to see the ViewTube videos _"We have 15 days to do the show. And to do what Diana asked us."_

_"Alright!"_ said Djanni.

They rehearsed all the free time they had, and they had a fundamental support: Brick-A-Brack and Mimi helped them while rehearsing and designing Djanni's clown face via video-conference.

And Jiminy did a good way to detect people that would be at the post-hypnotic suggestion from _Sword Verse_:

_"Djanni, we'll go and I'll use my_ Pretty Please! _in the middle of the parade to detect people that could be under a post-hypnotic trance like you were, then we'll indicate them for the others. The idea is that they'll be sent to Squirrel Girl for double-check and to remove the triggers from those that would really be under that suggestion."_ said Jiminy, after one of their rehearsals. 

_"Nice! That thing was horrible... Need to say, I never felt so much rage and hate when that time."_ said Djanni

_"And I think we can find people that are consciously working for that_ Sword Verse _guy. I also said Diana to publicly publish our report, specially my analysis on their power. This guy is full on hubris, he would make people try to find me. And if they did their job really good, five minutes of Net-Fu and they'll discover that Joshua McCarthy **IS** Jiminy Cricket **IS** Spotty the Clown."_ said Jiminy

_"But you'll be at risk!"_ said Djanni

_"As it's said in Go:_ 'Your life point is enemy's one' _If we don't show them we are after any intel on them, they'll not be feel endangered. If they feel that way, they'll sooner or later do some mistake. And on those mistakes we'll gather even more intel on them. We'll play_ sente, _having the initiative and pro-activity, and they'll play_ gote, _just doing what we are expecting them to."_ said Jiminy, getting ready for next skit rehearsal.

They did their best and, in the last rehearsal, they showed their show for Brick-a-Brack and Mimi, and they approved the skits, including the finishing one, _Dead and Alive!_

_"This is very classic, and as you'll be the 'dead', Joshua, Altayr will not have problems on moving and supporting you, as he's an Atlas. You just need, Altayr, to remember the timing for all things."_ said Michelle.

_"And remember to play silly and_ play safe." said Tammy.

_"Alright! Thank you! Tomorrow will be the day."_ said Joshua. _"They'll show this live on ViewTube. Diana thinks that this could be good PR for_ Herós Sans Frontières, _as we are people as everyone, except the powers."_

_"Sounds like a nice ideas."_ said Tammy _"Now, go take some sleep. Remember: clowns needs to be on their best to make people laugh."_

_"Right. Thanks for everything. Out."_ said Jiminy, finishing the talk.

Djanni and Jiminy woke up early next day and, after a good breakfast, they gone for a barrack that was near some of the _Clowns without Borders_ people where they left all the things from them as clowns, _Spotty_ and _Almuhraj_. They dressed on their clothes and made their makeup. LionHeart and Sugarplum came to them.

_"Dumont said everything is ready for the stream. Are you ready?"_ said Sugarplum

_"We are. Are you Almuhraj?"_ said Jiminy, or better, Spotty.

_"Ready! Bump a nose, Spotty!"_ said Djanni, or better, Almuhraj.

_"Diana said us to assure you you would be under Earbugs: we never know someone could try any weird thing."_ said LionHeart.

_"Okay."_ said Spotty, putting the Earbug.

_"Okay! Let's go! Bump a nose you two!"_ said Sugarplum, that knew that _Bump a Nose_ was the clown's _Break a leg_

Spotty and Almuhraj took their Kazoo Instruments and gone into a small car, and Sugarplum put a little charm on them before Cabby started to drive it all around _Roque Santeiro_, Spotty and Almuhraj playing silly renditions of musics and calling people for the show.

"Pretty Please, _came to 'Roque Santeiro together' show, it will be very funny!_ S'il vous plaît, _venez à 'Roque Santeiro ensemble', Ça va être très amusant!_ _Jamilat_ min fidlika, _watati 'iilaa 'ruk santiru maea' almaerid, wasawf yakun madhakaan jiddaan!"_ said both Spotty and Almuhraj all around the camp. It was Almuhraj, or better, _Djanni's_ idea: Jiminy never tried his _Pretty Please_ in other languages. Maybe, using the same trigger in other languages, he could lace people easily into his _Pretty Please!_

And Diana's and Djanni's ideas paid profits: here and there Spotty, or better, Jiminy, saw some people that didn't fell in the _Pretty Please!_ or react weirdly for it. the, he just did a little weird gesture into a direction and another that could pass as part of the zaniness, but, in fact, was a pointer for Sugarplum shows, via Mask-cam, the affected people. Squirrel Girl, Cajun, Corin and Dr. Derek Stiles, a small and timid doctor from CADUCEUS allocated at _Roque Santeiro_, gone and discreetly asked some questions for them, to find if any of them was under the _Sword Verse_ post-hypnotic suggestion, and then they could take them to be "worked by" Squirrel Girl so she could remove the triggers.

When they arrived to the big show stage, Spotty and Almuhraj gone for the backstage: there were already some musical shows happening, including ethnic music from some Leonean people, some of the locals that played also pop music, and other shows into a big festival, the so-called _'Roque Santeiro Together'_ show.

Like Dumont with his _Steam and Steel Show_, a kind of steampunk stage magic and performance show full of lights and things moving at the sound of _Carmina Burana_ and _TRON_ soundtrack. And a ballet presentation from Sugarplum that presented the _Sugarplum Fairy Dance_ from _Nutcracker_ ballet with some of the refugees that were ballerinas or had interest on dancing. Followed by the _Lucha_ challenge between Hufflepuff and _The Bronx Shoulder_, a big _Rudo_ that was, in fact, LionHeart under his old mask (all approved by his parole officer). They simulated a _Lucha de Apuestas_, but it was done into a way to make _Bronx Shoulder_ lose, having his mask ripped apart by Hufflepuff, after that LionHeart talked about himself (as people knew about him), and how there was always a way out of crime. 

By the end, Soldaire, into a very beautiful ringmaster-like costume said:

_"And now!"_ Soldaire said, and some local translators did the real-time translation in French, Arabic and some local dialects. _"To finish our_ 'Roque Santeiro together' _show, a little comedy show with two little clowns from our heroes roster. Please, everyone, gives a big cheer up for_ Clowns without Borders _and our little clowns_ Spotty _and_ Almuhraj!"

The people gave the cheer and all the clowns got there, and the zaniness started. Skit after skit they made the public roar in laughter, until came the last one, _Dead and Alive!_

They did all the intro, including the moment that Almuhraj gave a fake slap in Spotty (with all the safety precautions) and all the moments with Spotty 'dead', being moved and supported by Almuhraj, until, when they were in the last move, where Almuhraj took Spotty and held him over his shoulders, Spotty, or better, Jiminy, while making a zany face and waving for the crowd, saw something with his _Bellax Analytica_.

A guy with a weapon, a small one, that could kill him, even don't making more than a scratch at Djanni!

But they had thought all the time on this possibility during the rehearsals:

> _"If someone could attack us, we need to provide some codes that could indicate danger is coming, using them the presentation without changing things. When I'm in the 'board' moment, I could gave a little extra push into your legs... When you lift me, I could discreetly tap your side and so on And you also could provide some codes like that, so we could be safe from any tango."_

Jiminy just gave the taps into Djanni's side at the right time: when the guy shoot the gun, Djanni turned out and, using his Atlas' reflexes, he took the bullet into his hand, that felt no more than a wasp sting, and discreetly pointed to the man. Joshua felt something and he discreetly said via Earbug.

_"Suicide Bomber. Seize him!"_ said him. The guy was taking his hands to some detonator, but Cajun was smarter and faster: when he saw the guy trying to use the bomb, he had gone and cut the detonator wire and one of the man's hands. Everyone screamed, but the action was luckily timely: two Speedster came and took the guy away from the public.

_"Let us finish the show!"_ said Jiminy discreetly for Djanni _"Plan B ending!"_

Djanni put Jiminy at the floor and both of them bowed to the crowd, but then they looked at each other, Jiminy faking fear, Djanni faking anger, and they run out of the stage with people roaring out!

_"Jiminy, are you two okay?"_ said Diana, via Earbug, while Djanni cleaned some of the metal chips from his hand left by the destroyed bullet.

_"We're okay. Djanni just like if a wasp stung him when stopping the bullet. And the guy?"_ said Jiminy

_"We are profiling him now, but he's a recent arrive."_ said Diana _"Didn't looked like someone that could be a suicide bomber. Two options: sleeper agent or someone under a very powerful_ Sword Verse _post-hypnotic trance."_

_"Alright: any other intel? And the people Jiminy pointed?"_ said Djanni

_"All under the_ Sword Verse, _but already put under treatment"_ said Diana _"Now, go and take the greeting from the crowd: you deserve it more than they and you know."_ 

Hufflepuff and LionHeart took them over their shoulder and brought them to the stage, and everyone that was in the show looked for Soldaire that chose for some reason to sing _Heal the World_ from Michael Jackson as the last song, but with a slight touch of _Enka_ music, he dressed into a stylish _yukata_, with all the others going as a choir for him. In the end, all the people in the crowd was singing with them, and some of Dumont's fireworks blasted over _Roque Santeiro_, finishing a very important show.

_"Hope people learn on this all and help each other after this show."_ said Jiminy, taking a little bottle of water and, after taking a gulp, passing it to Djanni 

_"Sounds like they'll did. They loved the show and I think they understood the message..."_ said Djanni when Sugarplum came, taking her cellphone from the ballerina tutu.

_"Kids, look to this!"_ said her, showing some video reactions and hashtags from social networks. _#roquesanteiro, #healtheworld, #spotty_ and _#Almuhraj_ were in all the trending topics, but the best was see the video reactions from their parents (that were in Geneva) and from Mimi and Brick-a-Brack (that recorded on clown in a very zany way) praising the quality of their show.

_"Need to say that were also the kind of crap that creepy people say those times, but they were not even .1% of all the reactions. People all around the world loved it! And look!_ Rolling Stones _said this is the_ Post-Event Live-Aid, with breakthroughs instead of musicians! _We brought the house down!"_ said Sugarplum

_"Indeed, you made the donation site goes slashdotted!"_ said Diana, looking happy _"They needed to upgrade the hosting service to deal with the donations overload!_ Roque Santeiro _will be easily reconstructed will all the extra donations_ Herós Sans Frontières _and_ Mediciens Sans Frontières _will receive!"_

_"Great!"_ said Jiminy while Djanni gone for _"Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful!"_ 

_"And, extra good news: we now know who is this_ Sword Verse _guy. He sent a challenge for us and we are gathering enough intel about him!"_ said Diana, showing she was business.

_"So... Challenge Accepted!"_ said Dumont, doing a meme-like face.


## Chapter 15

> _"The_ Kafir, _the infidel Crusaders, mocked our ways and disrespected us, and the_ Zindiq _and_ murtadd, _the hereticals and aposthate, turned their back from the_ Ummah, _working with Shayaten and Iblis to bring the profanity in front of Allah the Most High. By talking about 'tolerance' and 'respect', the Crusaders they only repeat the heresies and hypocrisies they professed since Adam (Peace with Him). They can say sweet words, but only dung insects could be seen beyond them. No more this will be accepted. In the name of Allah the Compassionate and Merciful, I hereby urge the_ Ummah, _the people of Islam, against the Crusaders from that profanity den called_ 'Roque Santeiro', _from those who doesn't recognize the time of the_ Mahdi _is coming, and we are the ones sent to cleanse the harvest for the time of the_ Mahdi _and the fall of the_ Kafir. _Those who joins the Holy_ Jihad _will be the ones to join The Prophet (S.A.W) at the_ Firdaws. _Those who stay with the Crusaders will have less mercy under Allah than the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. We are the new_ Seif-al-Din, _the Blades of the Faith, to provoke more pain and hurt to the infidels and glory for Allah the Merciful. I'm the_ Sword Verses, Alsyf Alayat, _to urge the Ummah!"_

By urging the_ Sword Verse, _he is showing himself as over the_ Mahdi _and all the Prophets from the past, from Adam to Isa, or Jesus (Peace with Them) to Mohammad (S.A.W), almost like he was saying what everyone in_ Ummah _should do. We were never in past so cruel even with ours. If we are that cruel with our ones, how could us ask for peace and understanding with the infidels? Converting the infidel to Allah the Most High and show him the way of Peace under Allah the Forgiving voice should be the real reason of our lives, the real way to Praise the Most High. Otherwise, even the infidels would be better than us, because they can and would show mercy under Allah the Most High's eyes."_

They were all flabbergasted after looking the video.

_"So it is this? He wants to bring war against us?"_ said LionHeart

_"Those kind of guys are the worst."_ said Sugarplum _"It's not that different on what he does from what KKK and_ Humanity First _does. They don't want no talk, even with those 'like them': my  father had to shot some guys that gone against us in the afterwards of Jiminy's situation, including a neighbor that revealed himself as a_ Humanity First _supporter. He said them next time they tried to trespass our home, he would shot them dead."_

_"This is the problem."_ said Jiminy _"They are crazy, and they want to make people grow resent against those who they look like impure or so. It's like Kyle, it's like_ Humanity First, _it's like KKK, One Land... They are people full of hate and/or that can profit on all this! I don't know if we can show them they are deceiving themselves."_

_"No chance:"_ said Diana _"If those are one of those cheesy comics from pre-Event, they would go_ 'bwahahahahaha' _and we should now being_ SOCK BAMF BIFF WHACK _each other."_

_"The problem is:"_ said Zayn, via video-conference, from Geneva _"the Islamic people suffered a lot in all times. I'll not do a judgement, but Occident forgot the Islamic people a lot before and after the Event: this gave rise for nuts like_ Seif-al-Din _and_ Alsyf Alayat, _Sword Verses. But they are not innocent also: they are deluded, in the best case, or warmongers, in the worst. They like violence and pain, and blood and cries are their food and music."_ 

_"Jiminy, this video was laced?"_ said Dumont, worried _"The last thing we need now is another surge of crazy people."_

_"Doesn't look like."_ said Jiminy, shaking his head _"I think this guy has a flaw: he can induce hate, but not when himself is full of it. He need to convince himself and other he's doing 'the right thing', otherwise his_ Do as I said _power malfunctions. It's somehow like my own_ Pretty Please!, _but reversed: I can't induce hate on others, even if I want. He can, but only if not clear."_

_"But how he can do this?"_ said Djanni _"Islam is not about violence."_

_"Some people disagree with you, Djanni."_ said Kuntur _"Looks like this guy need to bring the idea of 'righteous violence' and 'vengeance' as a way of Justice, like in all the idea behind the Egypt Plagues and so, to do what he wants. And looks like his interpretation of Islam is all about violence. It's like we said: he's like KKK or_ Humanity First, _that cherry-picks what they want, either in the Bible or in the Qu'ran to justify their nonsense."_

_"There's another problem:"_ says Zayn _"Democracy and Individualism, for good or ill, is a very occidental concept. The orient, like Jews, Muslim and Far East religions and philosophies, are more focused in the community. Look how Japan deals with their breakthroughs, with compulsory indoctrination and training. No offenses, Soldaire."_

_"Apology accepted. But you're right."_ said Soldaire _"I had a strong, albeit respectful, debate about this with_ the Protectors _and_ the Heroes _during Metrocon: the lion's share from HSF from Japan are from_ ronin, _unregistered breakthroughs and the nearest thing into the western concept of villain we have in Japan, and  we still have problems to bring the best ones to us: they normally go for_ Yakuza. _I said Japan should contribute with more capes, or_ powers, _as we call capes in Japan, to HSF. But then they said me they live for the country, that they, and the most into the Japanese powers, even putting the_ ronin _on them, are focused into defending Japan against potential menaces. Only a few_ ronin, _like the deceased_ Three Remarkable Ronin _and_ Kitsune, _are okay with working overseas. I'm an exception into exceptions, being a registered Japanese power, that works overseas."_

_"So, outside the Occident, the community's value is bigger than the person's. This could be a good thing to achieve consensus, but they can also be a trap for fascism and other philosophies that suffocate the individual, and by those that thinks that their way is the best for everyone: many people goes into herd behavior very easily..."_ said Zayn _"And, in a situation like this, people like_ Alsyf Alayat _goes and flourishes."_ said Zayn, a snapshot from the guy into another video in the screen. _"See this video: I found it a little after the_ challenge video _was posted: a_ mullah _friend of mine send this for me after the recent declaration against_ Roque Santeiro _by Alsyf Alayat. I've already subtitled it and send it to everyone I thought that could need this knowledge. This, however, is still being treated as classified into HSF."_

The video started: the first thing Jiminy noted was he was using a kind of veil over his face, like Djanni did, but thicker than Djanni's, so he could see no facial traces, except by the eyes, full of hate and fanaticism.

> _"I've heard about the_ Zindiq _that doesn't accept the truth of my words under Allah the Most High. I will say again: I'm_ Alsyf Alayat, _Sword Verses, to bring the_ Kafir _and_ Zindiq _Allah the Most High's Justice. I've seen in the eyes of Allah, my face transfigured like Musa and Isa, and like Mohammad the Prophet (S.A.W) after being visited by Gibril. I can't show my face anymore, because I had seen the Glory of Allah the Most High: my face is anathema for those that is not from the_ Ummah. _My face vision burns the_ Kafir _and_ Zindiq, _for glory of Allah the Most High! Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful!"_ 

Djanni was really looking angry.

_"This is the biggest_ murtadd _I've ever saw."_ said Djanni, disgusted

_"He could does like he said? Burn others by his own look?"_ said Jiminy

_"I don't think so."_ said Squirrel Girl _"There was some registered events on this, but only with some_ Ultra _or_ Omega _guys, and you can count in your fingers how many could_ actually _burn people just by their looks. About_ mentally _do this, it's another story, as there is records on Psychotic Breakthroughs that were so horrid that shattered people's minds, what we call_ Cthulhu events. _Fortunately, they are very rare also, albeit many times more common than what this nut says he could do."_

_"I can say, securely: this one was not laced."_ said Jiminy _"It's safe, beside the hate speech."_

_"The biggest problem is: people listen to him."_ said Zayn _"The_ Caliphate War _scars hadn't healed yet: we know this all on_ Roque Santeiro. _And, to turn things worse, Israel is not giving a word about the_ Undying Caliphate _rise in the sub-Saharan Africa, beside the_ 'Caliphate is terrorist' _thing. But we know all this will end in the long run, and it will not_ Israel _or the_ Caliphate _that will suffer. It will be us all."_

_"Alright."_ said Hufflepuff _"So, our only option is to deal with this_ cabrón. _And what we know about him? Any intel?"_ 

_"We had gathered some intel about him, but in too many places, so much scattered and with so many security levels we needed to exert some influence and ask some favors to create a profile. Look like our 'friends' in intelligence community are trying to profit on all this. But, anyway, we have a profile we downloaded into your epads."_ said Diana, activating the holographic monitor.

_"This is_ Rahul Musa Al-Gazzawi, _now 36, at the time 18, an intel operative trained by CIA as a double-agent for_ Mossad _into the_ Palestinian Liberty Organization. _He worked during the_ Second Intifada _until The Event, when he was given as KIA, Killed In Action, until the beginning of the_ Caliphate War." said Diana, showing some photos and videos from the guy. Albeit younger, everyone could recognized him as the _Alsyf Alayat_, the Sword Verses.

_"In the beginning of the_ Caliphate War, _he was acting by the name of_ Mufti Musra Hussein Al-Gazzawi. _I know, very_ Cliché, _but he was acting as a freelancer intel seller, using his contacts to buy and sell some juicy intel that he took on the Event aftermath from the Chinese and North Korean defects, to both sides in the War. Until them, there's believed he was just a common guy, with lots of training, money and contacts, but otherwise normal."_

_"During the_ Caliphate War, _a black op was ordered to work against a Caliphate skunkwork, a kind of hedgy loosened think-tank, to enhance the chances of breakthrough during Breakthrough Camps. Looks like the project was coordinated by some of the Caliphate's_ big kahunas, _and people was starting on this kind of Cold War involving breakthrough mass-production."_ said Diana _"The action happened at Lebanon, as some of the main guys on this were from Hezbollah."_

_"The operation had three big objectives: acquire and/or destroy the research data, acquire the less radicalized elements, neutralize the others. The action was very successful, as many of the researchers defected to LDS side. There was believed that our man was in the one acquired. He joined the_ Caliphate _ranks to do his double-crossing."_ said Diana

_"So."_ said Dumont _"He escaped death. Again."_

_"Yup. But not too much time after, he defected US again and gone to the Balkans, and entered again into the old_ Caliphate _region via Kosovo and Kurdistan. After that, until now, LDS intel lost his scent, until the_ Roque Santeiro _attack."_

_"Could he be the big boss into the_ Undying Caliphate?" asked Djanni

_"Not the big, but certainly one of the biggest ones: some of the people at Kurdistan intel registered that he developed his power in Kurdistan, when a black op to neutralize him resulted into disaster, five Mariners dead by a local mob, not before killing dozens of them. It was the biggest post-Event fiasco and the biggest military fumble from US since Operation Eagle Claw."_ said Diana

_"Sounds like a Slash movie version of my own breakthrough! He felt menaced and thought on revenge against those who were pursuing him, and he thought on how to manipulate people to do this. And he maybe thought into the_ Sword Verse _and this triggered his breakthrough. So much hate and anger turned it into a psychotic breakthrough, with him dominating the mob to go against the Mariners. They had undergone a so strong_ Do as I said _that they just thrown their own safety to the dogs."_ said Jiminy, shivering _"That was very terrible."_

_"You're right, Jiminy. The only survivor was also under the_ Do as I said, _and he killed himself just after reporting back. It was a message from_ Alsyf Alayat _to his old friends to not mess with him."_ said Diana

_"I don't think, and this is good news,"_ said Jiminy _"That his powers are still that great. Normally, all breakthroughs has a surge of power after that, before he can fine control his powers. I didn't had this kind of thing because I'd gone comatose before."_

_"And we know where he is?"_ said Dumont

_"This is the main problem: he is hidden very well, like all the main_ Undying Caliphate _guys."_ said Diana _"But I think we need something to bring him to a trap."_

_"Or... Wait until his next try."_ said Jiminy _"I don't think they'll stop by now. The time they gave us is because themselves were under some shortage: think we had done some good show."_

_"But looks like the next one will be the worst."_ said Soldaire _"They'll certainly bring help and try to put us into shambles. All that_ Sodom and Gomorrah _language can be understood as this: he wants to go full war against_ Roque Santeiro. _So we can't wait him take the initiative and attack us."_

_"So, we'll need to investigate his last stop."_ said Jiminy _"As far we know, he was found last time in somewhere at Cote D'Ivore, Ivory Coast, but we can think he didn't gone that far. From what we profiled, he's not the main brain in the_ Caliphate, _but he's someone that like to be in the front-line, even being risky: as an old time intelligence worker, we can assume he has at least basic military training, and can defend himself from many breakthroughs."_

_"Yeah:"_ said Diana _"He was trained as a double agent and infiltrator, and also some as a saboteur. And it's reasonable to believe he can deal with breakthroughs. The good news is: as far the intel had collected, he doesn't have a_ Bellax Analytica-_like power. So, his strategies are based only on his field training and experience, not into precognition."_

_"I think he can be somewhere in Guinea, Mauritania, or Liberia, as the nearest countries, by the moves the_ Caliphate _did."_ said Jiminy

_"From these ones, Mauritania is the biggest sympathizer with the_ Caliphate. _Liberia should be discarded, as a Christian Majority county, so hostile to the_ Caliphate, _although can be more accepted at the north, in Lofa County, near Guinea. But even Guinea is a more secular country, so maybe hostile to the_ Caliphate. _It's sensible to think that he is into somewhere farther as base and crosses on those countries when needed."_ said Diana.

_"Now, we need to find him... And monitoring the videos on Deep Web. I think he's publishing more and more videos: if he laces it with_ Sword Verse, _we can see a spree of violence not only here, but everywhere."_ said Jiminy

And it was as Jiminy previewed: some seconds after Zayn showed himself in the main screen.

_"There's a report of riots at Tripoli."_ he said _"And the_ Caliphate _is declaring authority on it. I just received a video from a friend of mine. It's again_ Alsyf Alayat"

They saw the video: things were so hasty that Djanni had to do the translation job, aside some of them, like Diana, Jiminy and Squirrel Girl knowing the basics.

> _"Lo! The_ Ummah, _the People of Islam, is raising his blade and joining the Holy_ Jihad _against the_ Kafir _and the_ Zindiq!  Tarabulus al-Sham _will soon be cleansed from the stench of apostasy and blasphemy against Allah the Most High! Our Brothers and Sisters from the_ Undying Caliphate _are insurging against the infidel's slavery! Down with the Crusaders! Down with the Iblis' followers! We, the_ Ummah, _believers in the Allah the Most High and Mohammad his Prophet (S.A.W.), we'll bring fire and brimstone to the heretic, fire and brimstone to the aposthate, fire and brimstone with the infidel. We'll smite them first in Libya, and them from Africa and from the world, to glory for Allah and for the_ Mahdi!"

_"He's going even more radical."_ said Djanni

_"This can be good news if Jiminy is right."_ said Diana _"Jiminy, this thing was laced on the_ Sword Verse?"

_"Just in the beginning. As soon he came on all that_ Down with the Crusaders _thing, the power has faded."_ said Jiminy. _"As I said, I can see him having any kind of control on his power. He has a bigger sheer power then me, but, and I'll not humble myself on this, I have more, as Cajun says,_ finesse _on my power control. He can, when calm, put some strong post-hypnotic trances on their targets. In the first video was more calm, and see what he did on Djanni, even myself feeling some of the compulsion. In those last ones, his power is weaker."_

_"Looks like he's praying for their lot."_ said Dumont _"He's trying to unify the Muslims under himself..."_

_"And himself being the_ Mahdi!" said Djanni _"I felt this in the start of those video, but I didn't fell under this balderdash that time. And as Jiminy said, looks like he's going somewhat weaker. Not weaker in strict sense, but with less finesse, less subtlety."_ 

_"Alright."_ said Diana, that received some telephone calls in the meantime _"We are now under_ Code Red. _Looks like there's a big exodus of people coming from Libya, some evicted, some expelled. Basically the Christians and some secular Muslin, not affiliated to the main school of jurisprudence. This is in fact a kind of_ pogrom. _Now we need to ready ourselves: in four days or so they'll start to arrive. UNHCR already asked for local countries to help enforce a humanitarian corridor for those coming via Maghreb or Sahara. Some of the Berets will join local forces to enforce it, the details being passed soon to you. We'll need to ready everything so people can join us as soon they are triaged. I think you can help people to join here being well-received. Already asking HSF and UNHCR for extra supplies, mainly barracks and hygiene items, clothes and food. Sugarplum, I want you, Jiminy and Soldaire to help Squirrel Girl at the triage as soon they came: Lesley will train you in the main drill. Hufflepuff, LionHeart, Kuntur, Djanni, you'll help Dumont, Cabby and Corin to put everything ready and to guide everyone, and occasionally you'll help into security._ Roque Santeiro _is known on the integration rating, 95%. Now, let us go: there's more of 65 thousand people coming, it's a diaspora, and we need to be ready. We'll think on the_ Caliphate _and_ Alsyf Alayat _later."_

## Chapter 16

> _"The worst in all the_ Alsyf Alayat _situation was that people always looks for a savior, and the only Savior is Allah the Forgiving. Otherwise, people should not put faith on man, no matter what. This is a kind of apostasy that people doesn't talk about. It is difficult to accept we are all failable. We always looks for inspiring people, and we always end idolatrize them, when they should stay being inspiration, not devotion. They were as imperfect than anyone else, and should not be praised, no one should be beside Allah the Most High. But as all the Prophets, from Adam, Peace be with Him, to Mohammad the Prophet (S.A.W.), passing by Musra and Isa, Peace be with them, people should be source of inspiration, not focus of praising. Either by good deeds and bad ones, no matter is one from the_ Ummah _or an infidel"_

> **Zayn Tahan, _'On the_ Sword Verses (Alsyf Alayat)'s fatwa _and his understanding under the Holy Qu'ran'_, Herós Sans Frontières.**

Two weeks had passed, and there was still having some triage. A kind of temp camp was mounted emergencially outside _Roque Santeiro_, and people were getting into it before getting into _Roque Santeiro_. The security measures were enhanced, after all the attacks against _Roque Santeiro_: the menaces from _Alsyf Alayat_ and the _Tunisian Diaspora_, as called by the news, making things even worse. Some people were saying why the Breakthroughs didn't nothing against _Alsyf Alayat_, and some of them, like Mal Shankman, was saying this looking for  political profit, saying _"where is the so called capes, the false idols, when people were attacked at Tunis?"_ Because of this, _Varekai_ had enforced a PR lockdown at _Roque Santeiro_: all communications involving local personnel would be screened to avoid PR problems.

Not that Jiminy was involved on all this PR thing: in the time between his shifts at triage, he was always studying and talking with his parents at Geneva, as they were worried with him since the video were _Alsyf Alayat_ revealed himself. Jiminy was not that calm, but he knew his force and his team's.

_"And, to be fair, mom,"_ said Jiminy, in the video-conference call _"we are as safe here than we could be anywhere else: lots of Berets and breakthroughs, and everyone helping into the security. If this guy really wants us, he will move Heaven and Hell to find us. Here, at least, I have the team and they have me. And, after all, they'll came against me, Jiminy Cricket, at least if he wants to play by the Rules. And if not, there's nothing I can do besides stay safe."_

_"Are you sure, sweetie? Fathama is also worried with Altayr."_ said his mother.

_"Djanni is strong, and he can, with us, deal with_ Alsyf Alayat. _Okay, he fell under his power once, but there's a kind of unwritten rule about this and he will not get under this again. And, as far I have him, he have me. It's like rock-paper-scissors: we cover each other. We can deal those meanies."_ said Jiminy.

_"Alright son:"_ said his mother _"but do your job, rest and don't let this guy win. We'll be praying for your safety."_

_"Sure, mom. Thanks... Now, need to go: my shift at the triage will start soon."_ said Jiminy

_"Alright, son. Take care."_ said his mother.

Jiminy took a ride with Djanni to _Roque Santeiro_'s entrance and got into the triaging tent put outside the camp. Some local Berets were there, doing the security and helping the first screening, while the others did the profiling: by using some connections with intel personnel, the local Asimovs had built a database of possible POI involving the _Caliphate_ and organized some questions that could help them to find people that could be under the _Sword Verses_: those were send for extra screening with _Squirrel Girl_ to have their post-hypnotic triggers removed. Took time, but was effective.

Jiminy was now seeing interviewing a guy who looked a little meek, but young. He was dressed into some of the common clothes for desert, so he came via the Maghreb/Sahara humanitarian corridors. He looked very simple.

_"Do you speak English?_ Parlez vous Français? Hal tatakallam arabiya?" said Jiminy.

_"I speak all them, but if you feel better, I'll speak English."_ said the man, with a strong Arabic accent.

_"Alright."_ said Jiminy _"So, what's your name and from where you came from?"_

_"I'm Saleh Tamir Abdul-Samad. I'm from Tataouine."_ said the man

_"Are you single? Have kids?"_ said Jiminy

_"No for both."_ said Saleh, while Jiminy was filling a little form into a notebook connected to _Roque Santeiro_ system. It was a prodigy on Agile Development what the local Asimovs did, to build in less than a week a system crossing thousands of terabytes of data. There was systems that did this and even more easily, but the feat was do so much in so little time.

_"Okay... Just a minute."_ said Jiminy, waiting some data to be retrieved.

It was when things gone to the dogs.

_Bellax Analytica_ has some flaws:

First, he can't preview too much without risking go haywire: to fore-view the actions of many people, he needs to restrict it to some seconds, or even fractions of a second. If he want to fore-view more time, he need to "remove" people from the analysis.

Second, albeit all his training, _Bellax Analytica_ was not a kind of _all-time_ power: when he needs to do things, he need to somewhat consciously "boot up" it. Otherwise, he isn't on. After "boot up", Jiminy would not need to engage consciously, except to fine tune the time/event relations.

But, in the case, Jiminy was not with it engaged, as it was strenuous in the long run.

When five people cried together _"Allahuh Akbar!"_

Three of them engaged the local MaxBerets, while another gone for Djanni, when he saw the last one going for Jiminy.

Saleh.

Jiminy just had time to think _"Sleeper Agent?"_ and holding his Jiminy Cane in his hand before the guy jumped and hit him straight in the belly, making him lost his air. _"Not Atlas."_ thought Jiminy, but then the guy said: _"Sorry kid, but there's someone that want to see you."_, before Jiminy felt something wrong before going unconscious. 

He felt the vacuum that formed normally into a teleportation.

---

_"JIMINY!"_ cried Djanni, when he saw Sugarplum blasting some magical energy blast against one of the guys that engaged the MaxBerets!

_"We have a situation!"_ said Squirrel Girl, spraying another of them with her skunk tail perfume, before changing her arms into a bizarre cross between kangaroo and honey badger's _"Sleeper Agents!"_

_"We're dealing with them!"_ said Soldaire, engaging his _SolArmor_ to engage the last guy, while the Berets secured the safety of the other refugees _"Engage camp lockdown!"_

_"Roger!"_ said Diana, in Dispatch

The fight was rapid and furious, but the four other guys had been defeated very fast.

When they noted that Jiminy was no more there!

_"Dispatch, Jiminy is not here!"_ said Soldaire

_"We are checking the video..."_ said Diana

_"I saw them: the last guy was a teleporter! He took Jiminy!"_ said Djanni, worried

_"We are crossing intel based on the last guy!"_ said Diana _"Looks like the name of that guy was fake, the system is showing."_

_"Those_ Zindiq! Murtadd!" screamed Djanni in frustration
 
_"Calm down, Djanni! Being furious will not help Jiminy."_ said Soldaire, disengaging the SolArmor.

_"Those guys are crazy! They... They'll behead Jiminy!"_ said Djanni, desperate.

_"We'll work on find Jiminy ASAP."_ said Dumont _"Looks like he took his Cane. If so, there's no way someone hide Jiminy from us for too much."_

---

Jiminy woke up into a cell like place, still a little flinched, and he saw through the window: there was some desert nearby, so he knew he wasn't at _Roque Santeiro_ no more, maybe even at Sierra Leone. He was on his costume, but his mask, hat and cane were took from him. His head was supported on an old pillow and the mattress were he was laid was rough, but at least he was alive.

_"Hope they didn't discarded the_ Jiminy Cane _before came here."_ thought Jiminy

In the aftermath of the second attack against _Roque Santeiro_, Jiminy asked Dumont to put on his things some active trackers that sent his location for a special system at Geneva. Only five people could get his location: Dumont, Soldaire, Diana and his parents.

He was feeling some aches on his body, but he looked otherwise okay: nothing hurt, broken, sprained or twisted. His cell was small, but not filthy, and looks like he had at least somewhere to sleep, a bunk bed like those from military facilities, a kind of latrine and a little old fashioned shower. A mirror and an old sink with a faucet were nearby, and a small table with a stool was fixed in the opposite wall from the bed. There were bars into the window and the door was heavy, maybe steel.

_"Okay, I'm not hurt, so those guys have some interest on me. In fact, if they just wanted me killed, they would did this at_ Roque Santeiro." thought Jiminy, when a guy entered into the room and, before Jiminy could even speak, he said, pointing a pistol to Jiminy. 

_"You talk and try to use your_ Pretty Please, _you die, simple that. Nod if you understand."_ said the man, with a very accented English, and Jiminy nodded.

_"Right. No talk or get out from this room, without some of our group. You'll be treated well for a_ Kafir. _Food three times a day, shower has warm water for a good shower per day. You can drink water from the faucet, it's clean. The latrine slab is over the shower, so clean it during the shower. You're responsible by cleaning the cell, and will be punished if you left things messy or dirty. The things are in that corner. We took your devices and mask. Understood? Nod."_ said the man, and Jiminy nodded. 

_"We'll put the food and clean clothes through that wheel."_ said the man, pointing it. _"You have half an hour to eat. Put back the tray to the wheel when finished. No talk to anyone, except when asked. Nod if OK."_ Jiminy nodded again.

The man got out the room and closed the door, when Jiminy heard the wheel being spun. He saw a little tray with food, basically Arabic food, a Couscous with some fish and potato. Jiminy felt hungry, and he didn't know how much time had passed. He took the tray and sat near the small table, taking the stool, and started to eat, taking a glass of water to make it go down. It was not exactly what he wanted, but it was food, it was somewhat good, and he needed to deal with them by staying calm.

Just a little time after he put the tray back the wheel, the wheel had spun again and there was a small package. As soon as he took the parcel, the wheel spun again, and again, and another time, each time with another parcel, every time spinning after Jiminy took the parcels. The last one, a little piece of paper was there. Jiminy took it and read. It was written in English, French and Arabic.

> _"These parcels are all that you'll need here. No need to stay on costume: we know you."_

Jiminy opened the parcels: there was some Arabic fashioned clothes, big robes and dresses, some underwear and a pair of traditional looking shoes, some towels and piece of cloth, a small necessaire with shampoo and a somewhat good scented soap bar. A pillow and some blankets were next. The pillow was still a little rough, but not that he could not stand, as the blankets that looked a little thin. In a little box there was a small block of paper and a common pen, and a copy of the _Holy Qu'ran_, very beautiful. There was an inscription in the box: _"may Allah have mercy on you,_ Kafir". Anyway, Jiminy couldn't do anything beside think by now. 

_"If they left the Qu'ran here, they are trying to convert me. Not because my soul, but because my power. They want me to their numbers as a second source for_ Sword Verses. _So, let us play under their own game by now. It's not too much different on what dad did with that preachers that messed our Sunday getting in front of our door."_ he thought, and he took to read the Qu'ran. _"If this cell is monitored, they'll know if I read the Qu'ran or not. So, better cooperate by now, until I have more intel about where I am."_

_"We need to rescue Jiminy, and we need to do this NOW!"_ said Djanni, frustrated.

_"It's not this way."_ said Diana _"But we can't take Jiminy and gave those nuts what they wanted. And this_ IS _exactly what they want."_

The meeting was called ASAP, and in the meantime _Roque Santeiro_ was into a total lockdown: no one got in or out. All the main capes were there, and there was also Cajun, Cabby, Corin, Squirrel Girl, Kilimanjaro and Panther (real names: Josephine 'Josie' Nondaba and Robert 'Bob' Nsele), the last two ex-villains helped by Jiminy to get out from a problem with Derek Kwazani, now under parole at _Roque Santeiro_.

_"We detected very fast were he is. The good news is: we know were he is, at least by now. The bad news is: he's under_ Alsyf Alayat'_s hand."_ said Dumont

_"We discovered who were those guys."_ said Cajun _"Canada intelligence reported them as five Islamic radical from Montreux. They were not that good as breakthrough and they were all second generation Muslims, so Canadian Born, except by their leader. The leader was Rashid Bahri, a Pakistani veteran from the_ Caliphate War. _He was registered a POI by the Pakistani Intelligence, but he was clear, so no Interpol information. As far as Pakistani intel was correct, he was a B-Class Teleporter, and has some combat training in things like Philippine_ escrima _and so."_

_"The system was not fast enough to catch him before he got Jiminy."_ said Sugarplum _"It was like they foresaw our plan. That creepy_ Alsyf Alayat _has a_ Bellax Analytica _power?"_

_"We can see this as no concern."_ said Soldaire _"This was the kind of plan someone could try to see if pay profits. In fact, it was our fault by not ensure Jiminy was always with his_ Bellax Analytica _engaged. But, if_ Alsyf Alayat _was all that clever, and we suppose he is, he would try a plan like this: no risk and big profit. And, even if things goes wrong, he could always place an sleeper agent."_

_"Now... What can I do? Where Jiminy is?"_ said Djanni

_"Djanni, if our intel is correct, based on the tracking devices at the_ Jiminy Cane, _Jiminy is somewhere at Tataouine, south of Tunisia, nearby Algeria and Libya, both of them with_ Caliphate _sympathy. The LDS is now pressing both of that governments to help fighting the_ Alsyf Alayat _insurgence at Tunisia, but both they are being morose, in the best case. As a little more secular one, Algeria looks like a more probable help."_ said Dumont

_"And we don't know how much time we'll have. I had put already to the_ big kahunas: _we'll give 72 hours to LDS find out Jiminy, or our team will go supervillain"_ said Soldaire, making everyone gasp

_Go Supervillain_ was the breakthrough term for go black-op: it's a big situation for any team to do this, and if he's readying something like this, Soldaire was ready to not give a damn for politics.

_"He crossed all the lines."_ said Diana _"I need to say that I'll stay with LDS, but if they bring the Foxtrot, they'll dance. No matter what, Jiminy was a non-combatant. Taking him is a big no-no, and they should not did this. Now, it's certain we need to give a response, and now we should go Havoc with them."_

Everyone was pissed enough with this.

And they would be even more pissed:

_"Everyone, new video from this guy at the Deep Web."_ said Mr. Tahan _"They are commemorating Jiminy's kidnapping."_

The video was played and the _Alsyf Alayat_ was on his veiled video:

> _"Lo! Allah is Merciful! Our brothers had put the hand into the asp's nest, and the asp didn't bit them. And they brought with them one of the asp's brethren, the Demon Spawn, the one who messed with the hearts of our brothers, the infidel with honey and poison in his mouth, the face of a kid and the vileness of_ Shayaten _himself, the so called Jiminy Cricket. In some days, he'll be judged by his apostasy, his heresy, his disbelief. And we'll bring him Justice under Allah the Most High, and Allah will have no Compassion on the infidel, and the forces of_ Shayaten, _the infidel Crusaders will be smitten in glory of Allah the High One! Lo! Allah is Merciful!"_

Djanni just screamed: "MURTADD!"

Sugarplum looked to him and said: _"Now, Djanni, we need to calm down and be into our best mind. Jiminy is strong."_

Kilimanjaro agreed: _"She's right. You saw him crazy during our encounter in the home of our gods. He was touched by the_ Oya _and survived. He saved Senesie and our souls, and my grandmother had him under good look. We need to trust him being okay, and we need to do our best to stay calm, do a good plan and take him back."_

_"We just received some intel."_ said Corin _"If this is the place Jiminy is, he's nearby the Tataouine old French Foreign Legion base. Looks like the_ Caliphate _took it as their own. We'll confirm the intel, but there's nothing what we can do by now."_

_"And now, we'll sleep and ready ourselves. We'll think on this as a team tomorrow."_ said Diana, dismissing the meeting _"Take some sleep. There's nothing more we can do now, and be tired tomorrow and in the next days will not help Jiminy."_

---

In the end of the day, Jiminy heard a man shouting something somewhere a little far away. He knew, by a kind of _Islam for Dummies_ crash course Djanni gave his team, this was the _muezzin_ from the local mosque. By the light dimming, Jiminy knew it was going to be night. The wheel span and there was again a paper, this time just in English: "Alsyf Alayat, _Peace with Him, will came to talk with you after the_ Isha, _the last prayer. Clean yourself, and make yourself respectable in respect of him. Put your costume on the wheel as soon you dress out."_

Jiminy chose to not cross them, at least not until he have information enough to deal with them. Also, he was messy and dirty, so would have a use on a good bath and put clean clothes. So, while they were praying, and he could hear the last of the mandatory _salat_ prayers, he took a bath and put clean clothes, changing his costume to a set of Bedouin-like clothes from the parcels he took throught the wheel. The clothes were traditional and clean. Then, he folded and put his costume at the wheel.

While waiting the prayers to end, he read the Qu'ran, until he heard the door opening. A small guy, with a veil hiding his face, came in and took a little LED lamp.

_"Sorry. This old infidel base had not light normally, and we didn't installed light bulbs on the cells."_ said the man, into a unbelievable polite tone. _Alsyf Alayat_ was looking _Jiminy Cricket. "Let us not play games each other: we know how much each of us can do, or at least some."_ said Alsyf Alayat

_"So, are you Rahul Musa Al-Gazzawi?"_ said Jiminy _"I know you know my name is Joshua McCarthy. You did your intel gathering on me, otherwise you would not attack Spotty the Clown, you wouldn't know I'm also him."_

_"Right about us know about you. You're a very clever kid. Hope the Qu'ran illuminate you and you surrender yourself under the_ Shadahah, _understanding that only Allah is God and Muhammad (S.A.W) his only Prophet."_ said Alsyf Alayat _"But, answering you, I'm no more_ Rahul Musa Al-Gazzawi. _I'm_ Alsyf Alayat, _the Sword Verses. I've saw the Djinn and the Prophet, and my face can burn those who's not from the_ Ummah. _But you're somewhat right, because, like from the larvae came the pupa and came the butterfly, from the materialistic, almost_ Zindiq _Rahul Musa Al-Gazzawi came the Faithful_ Alsyf Alayat, _that was blessed by Allah the Most High with the power to urge those from the Islam to the_ Holy Jihad."

_"And what about me: I'm not a combatant, never was. I just wanted to avoid people to hurt themselves."_ said Jiminy

_"No, kid... What you did was apostasy by refraining the arm of Allah to cleanse that unholy place called_ Roque Santeiro. _But you are an infidel, at least by now, and you don't understand. Maybe you'll surrender yourself under the_ Shadahah, _and then you'll see how wrong his supposed friends are. If not, there's nothing I can do for you, because I will not have compassion on you, because this is Allah's will."_ said Alsyf Alayat _"You'll have from now seven days and nights. During this time you'll be treated well. If you not surrender yourself under the_ Shadahah, _by free will and pure heart, you'll receive Allah's justice, and them you'll sent to Fire and Brimstone at Hell's Slates in the Reckoning. Think well, and ask Allah for illumination."_ he said, before getting out, leaving the LED light behind.

_"So... Those are his terms:_ 'join me or die.'" thought Jiminy _"Hope the others came soon, or there'll no more Jiminy Cricket. I'll not accept turn myself into something like him: he's crazy."_

Jiminy got to the bed and nod off...

Albeit he woke up in the night... And saw there was someone else there.

## Chapter 17

> _"People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually — from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint — it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff."_ 
>
> _The Doctor, **Blink**_

The guy had a dark curled hair, with a tired gaze and a five-o'clock beard. beside the bed. He wore a long evening coat, cream-colored with a soft texture that looked almost like velvet, over gray slacks and shirt with a darker vest and tie. He put a small index finger over his lips before Jiminy could scream.

_"Calm down, Jiminy Cricket."_ said the man _"I came here to talk, and it's important."_

_"Who are you? How do you know my name? Are you a teleporter?"_ said Jiminy

_"No, Jiminy Cricket. I've saw about you in the future. I'm the Teatime Anarchist."_ said the man, making Jiminy gasp. 

Teatime Anarchist: the buffoon guy turned into one of the Biggest Super-villains after The Event, some even considered him The Big Bad Guy overall. A death toll of thousands was credited to him.

But, why for Jiminy he looked so meek? And... 

How he came back from the dead? He died into an explosion just some days after The Big One.

_"Now, I don't know if you believe me or not, and I'll not try to convince you of anything, except of two things: first, I'm the Teatime Anarchist for real and, two, I have no harmful intention against you."_ he said, putting a little device in the ground, that looked like a thin hockey puck. The device released a light blue light that expanded until cover all the cell.

_"A little humming device from 22nd century. They will not hear us talking outside, but it's better be into a place where you, and better, me, can't be seen."_ said the Anarchist, going to a corner back the window _"Now, let us talk."_

_"Why me?"_ said Jiminy

_"I saw your future, or better, your_ **potential** _futures. I need to say that there's some interest on you from my part, but it is a good one. And I'm able to time travelling, before asking me how I saw them."_

_"You're what? How could you have any good interest on me? And what about the people you killed?"_ said Jiminy

_"It was not me, but my, you could say, evil twin. I can't explain it all now. Maybe later you'll have all the answers you need. I need to ask you if you think it was weird Blackstone have any interest on you during_ Metrocon." said him, and this made Jiminy understand he was a really a time traveller.

_"I can't say I was not honored, I just didn't understood why one of the founder members of the_ Chicago Sentinels, _the superhero team by definition, and an ex-US Mariner would be interested into a little kid from Newark."_ said Jiminy

_"It was because my Future Files."_ said Teatime Anarchist _"I know that in your time, I was already deceased: in fact, our talk is happening under just some time in my relative past before the events of my death. You may be ask about free will, but in fact I_ have _the free will: I don't know how I'll die, but I know where and when. I can postergate this a lot into my relative future, but I can't avoid this."_

_"But..."_ said Jiminy

_"I can't take too much time to explain you all the physical and philosophical impacts on time-travelling. What I can say is about your futures, or at least the most potential ones, and those from some of your allies, and why everything is at risk."_

_"What?"_ said Joshua

_"In all your potential timelines, you've become a breakthrough. In all of them, you have more or less the same power set you have now, but your capename and power uses would differ a lot."_ said the Anarchist, starting to lecture him on his potential futures.

_"Let us first say those futures that could no more get on, mainly because you've undergone the breakthrough later on your life or had gone to Whitlow or Hillwood instead to HSF: the first one was called_ Ambassador _and your power was called_ Let's Talk. _You could make people agree with you on things, as far you could talk with them directly. Your power could not make people change their mind totally, but you could somewhat bend a little both parties to agree on something. This turned you into a very important person at UN and LDS, and you even, in one of those futures, arranged a peace agreement between the Caliphate, there a political party, and Israel. Sadly, in all those futures you were killed by someone that wanted to use you as a martyr or a scapegoat for war."_

_"Another one was called_ CEO. _In those futures, you were an undercover breakthrough that used his power_ Do as I've said _to make people_ Consume! _You could induce anyone to buy or do what you want, at least if it was a single action that would not demand them to go against some boundaries, like go violent and so. You made great money using them, but in many of those futures tragically you killed yourself, either into a single stroke, by shooting himself to the dead or something else like, or gradually, by abusing drugs or meds. All this because your life grown empty, specially when you lost or severed voluntary your connections with your family and friends, going ultra-capitalist."_ that one made Jiminy shiver.

_"Now, the third potential future, and a possible one somehow, is called_ Dominion. _Yes,"_ said the Anarchist looking Jiminy gasping. _"I know that was one of that Kyle kid for 'good' Mastermind names. Your power on this was called_ Sovereign, _and it was very simple: you could use it only once against someone, but as soon you did, the person got totally under your will and would execute your order 100% no matter what, to the point to ignore his own safety and freedom to do what you want, more or less like the_ Sword Verse. _In this one, many times you were killed by some other breakthroughs, including your friends from_ Herós Sans Frontières, _and in others you were killed by revolted normal people. At least in one of them, you were the final reason to a dictatorship goes under US."_

_"And, the fourth and most probable one, is your actual one as_ Jiminy Cricket. _Curiously this is the only one that I couldn't saw you being killed in action. In all of them, you turned into a kind of mentor for new heroes, taking the mantle of Blackstone or helping others at_ Herós Sans Frontières _or other CAI Teams in your relative future."_ said the Anarchist. _"Problem is that, at least in four of them, you forfeited being_ Jiminy Cricket, _either by retiring early, or by assuming other of the names, normally after some tragedy, like losing your parents or friends, or seeing some of them going supervillain. On those cases, you normally gone_ CEO _or_ Dominion." said the Anarchist

Jiminy was in the verge of crying: why this guy were there, talking all this, when he was trying his best to not panic?

_"You're full of fear, even panicking. This is good."_ said the Anarchist, to Jiminy's abashment _"If you heard your own future and all the possible ways to die you had, and you wasn't full of fear, you would either be insane or arrogant, both of them not good."_

_"But what are you telling me all this?"_ said Joshua 

_"To protect you somehow."_ said the Anarchist _"You think he took you just to convert you to Islam and make you radicalize? That's nonsense. Your powers are the exact opposite of them: in fact, in some of your futures, after getting in contact with Djanni, you and your family converted to Islam, sure, but in almost all of them you stayed as Jiminy Cricket. Just in one of them, you had radicalized, the only one that you took the_ Alsyf Alayat _mantle. Curiously, in this one, you were killed by Djanni. In one of them, you exchanged places, by you acting in the operation to kill Djanni, then called_ Ifrit."

Jiminy was flabbergasted on all of this, and really scared.

_"Don't worry: this is just_ potential _futures. Your_ REAL _future is your own. It's like me: I know I'll die and how and when, but what I'll do until them is my own. Knowing your potential futures doesn't remove your free will. What you'll do with this knowledge is all about you, and you only, no matter what people like_ Alsyf Alayat _believes."_ said the Anarchist.

_"But, if he doesn't want me to be at his side, why he kidnapped me."_ said Jiminy

_"What do you know about Derek Kwazani and his_ Breakthrough Enticing Drug?" said the Anarchist. Jiminy just gasped.

_"What? He wants to..."_ said Jiminy

"Alsyf Alayat _wants intel about Derek Kwazani's whereabouts. In fact, he developed his powers after using the_ BED." said the Anarchist, and Jiminy gone even more flabbergasted. The Anarchist ignored that fact and continued: _"In some of the grim potential future, either Kwazani or_ Alsyf Alayat _used the BED to create a country-sized supervillain team, which resulted on almost all sub-Saharan Africa being sterilized using nukes until it was reduced to dust, including almost all the Maghreb in the process. In others, the nationalist forces dispersed itself, nations fragmented and gone into local fight, shattering Africa back to tribalism and ethnical conflicts. No matter what, politically speaking, in those futures, and potentially in your own, BED was a bigger power-balance change event than The Event itself, because it had  not only_ privatized _force, but also_ commoditizing _it: given enough money, anyone could be a cape. In one of them, this result into a psychotic breakthrough pandemic that create a kind of super-powered version of a zombie apocalypse. Curiously, in this future, your associate called Sugarplum became a supervillain under the name_ Morrigan, _with a Succubus-like Supernatural power set."_

_"Stop saying this meanie things!"_ said Jiminy, almost crying.

The Anarchist stopped and looked for Jiminy face, that was full of fear and almost panicked.

_"Sorry..."_ said the Anarchist _"Normally I deal with more adult people. I forgot that, no matter what you are, you're still a kid."_ 

_"Don't patronize me!"_ pouted Jiminy _"Just stop saying me and my friends could go meanie!"_

_"No, you're right. I should not had pushed you too much. But I need to say, Jiminy Cricket, that this event with_ Alsyf Alayat _will be an ordeal in so many things."_ said the Anarchist _"If you want my help, I can, but it can be very dangerous, even potentially lethal."_ he said, pushing him a kind of box. Looking into it, Jiminy saw a little pearl-like ball.

_"This is future technology like my humming device, from the 22nd century I came from. I can't give you all the details, I have not so much time. But I can say that this is a kind of a quantum link to a computer in the future that will connect you with other people all around the world. They can help you and you can help them: remember that isn't just_ Herós Sans Frontières _that wants_ Alsyf Alayat." said the Anarchist

_"You said it would be dangerous."_ said Jiminy

_"There's another device on this that you can use to call me if needed, that you can activate by hitting your belly. This will activate a time-space beacon that will let me found you no matter where or when. Never tried to use this one with a so small kid. I can say that the last one that tried to use it as a beacon was an A-Class Atlas and it hurted, or will hurt, as hell on her. But otherwise, this will link you with people that can help you. I can't say too much more, because I don't know if you want this help. However, it's now or never, your choice. Sorry about this, but I have not too much time."_ said the Anarchist.

_"Okay: just take this will be hurtful?"_ asked Jiminy

_"Maybe. As I said, I never give this bioseed for a so young person before. In the adults, it was like take a med pill. I don't know the impact of this into someone like you."_ said the Anarchist

_"Alright: let us take this. I don't have too  much time anyway. Those_ Caliphate _guys wants to turn me into a weapon for them, and I'll not let them do this."_ said Jiminy, taking the pearl-like and going to drink some water. 

_"At least, if we're lucky, this will grow in time to provide you help."_ said the Anarchist _"This bioseed will dissolve into your guts and then will connect itself to your brain, providing you access to the help, and installing also the beacon on you. In adults, this took some time until being activated, as they are bigger than you. As a kid, I think this will grow before the six days time gave to you by_ Alsyf Alayat." said the Anarchist, while Jiminy was swallowing the pearl-like ball. _"Remember, the beacon should be your last resort, as it's something painful even for an A-Class Atlas."_

_"Okay..."_ said Jiminy, when he fell his belly aching.

_"Looks like it will start fast."_ said the Anarchist _"Let me help you to the bed."_ 

The Anarchist gave Jiminy another glass of water and removed one of the blankets, as Jiminy looked growing feverish, sweat running from his forehead.

_"You're growing hot: think that is the start of the bio-seeding. Don't worry: sometime this start is not too good. But tomorrow morning you'll be okay."_ said the Anarchist _"Now, rest and take a good dream: it's the best way to defend yourself against the nightmares of the reality."_ he finished, while getting back to the center of the cell, taking the puck-like humming device.

As soon Jiminy closed his eyes, everything gone back dark like the Anarchist was never there.

## Chapter 18

> _"My contact with the Anarchist was really weird, but I can understand that sometimes people goes supervillain by noble causes. It's sad, but at least those people are honest, by assuming the evil part. I don't know if I would be able to do this, though."_
>
>  **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

During the next days, Joshua made all he could to not cross the guys. The good news is that, the morning after the contact with the Anarchist, he was as good as new. 

He was all the time left with just the Qu'ran and almost no human contact, so Jiminy read it, at least to memorize and extract what he could to argue about when asked by. It was in the third day night that Alsyf Alayat had came to give some talk with him about what he was understanding about the Qu'ran. He was harsh, but not aggressive, when Jiminy saw he didn't saw why Christians and Muslin could not live without fight.

_"You're a child. Children should not get into the adults' affairs and in the realm of politics, and to try to understand the_ Jihad..." said Alsyf Alayat

_"But, if I remember, some of the old books from Greeks and Romans were saved and studied by the Islamic philosophers in the past. As far I remember, Plato, Socrates and Aristotle just came to West thanks to the effort of Islamic philosophers and mathematicians."_ said Jiminy

_"Kid, it was for glory of Allah that we took the knowledge from the infidels. It's not wrong to took what the infidels did as ours. It's wrong to partake with them."_ said Alsyf Alayat

_"Like you did?"_ said Jiminy, and when he saw Alsyf Alayat all red, Jiminy saw that the Anarchist was right. _"I've read some intel about a unconfirmed thing about you, that you undergone your breakthrough by using the_ Breakthrough Enticing Drug. _This could explain why your_ Do as I said _power,_ Sword Verse, _only can induce hate on others."_

_"First of all, it's not hate: I urge those of the_ Ummah, _the believers, for the Holy_ Jihad _against the infidel. I saw Gibril and the Prophet (S.A.W), while I was agonizing after taking that thing. And now, I'm the_ Sword Verse _incarnate_, Alsyf Alayat. _Second: it's justice. Since the Crusades the West ignored us. The Christians and Jews, albeit being part of the People of the Book, they assume they are the Chosen, but they have their heresies under Allah: and they tried to suppress us because they can't see Allah gave us the main resources in the world."_ said Alsyf Alayat

_"So, after all, it's all about money."_ said Jiminy, calmly.

It was when Jiminy saw he almost crossed the line.

Alsyf Alayat lifted his hand, almost slapping him, but he gave a smirk and said: _"You're just a child, and an infidel one. You can't understand what my people suffered."_

_"Don't patronize me."_ said Jiminy _"I was almost lynched to death before going breakthrough. I saw Djanni being picked by other bullies in_ Roque Santeiro. _Christians, Jews, Muslims... no matter what, bullies are always bullies. This can go for governments and so. My friend Djanni always talked me about_ Jihad, _and said that, in his point of view, as he learned from his parents, the Greater_ Jihad _were even more important than the Lesser_ Jihad."

_"You are wiser than you look: by hearing the words of your friend of the_ Ummah, _you started your path to surrender yourself under the_ Shadahah. _But there's no Lesser or Greater_ Jihad: _this is saying from the sheep and from the_ Zindiq. _There's only the_ Jihad. _Your friend is deluded, as his parents, by believing that live under the infidel would bring them happiness."_

"'But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou also incline towards peace, and trust in Allah; for He is One that hears and knows all things.' _Verse 61, eighty_ Sura." said Jiminy, showing him the Qu'ran _"It was not me that said this, but the Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W) enlightened by Allah the Most High"_

_"At least, you're wise to try to see your arguments into the Allah's Words. But soon you will see your errors and surrender yourself under the_ Shadahah. _And then, we'll take you the information we need to provide even more_ Mujaheddin _for Allah the Most High. Or, your sacrifice will call the_ Ummah _for us, cleaning their ears from the infidels' lies"._ said Alsyf Alayat, doing the _salaam_, the ritual greeting, leaving Jiminy's cell.

_"So, it was like the Anarchist was right."_ thought Jiminy _"This guy wants me to provide him information about Derek Kwazani and his_ Breakthrough Enticing Drug. _He doesn't know that this is something embargoed by the UN and CADUCEUS as classified intel, just it's existence bringing problem into this_ Breakthrough Cold War _that, as Dumont says, is happening since the_ China _and_ Caliphate Wars." thought Jiminy. _"But now... How much time until that help came to me? My time is growing short."_

Jiminy thought it was a good idea just sleep, but he heard a little giggle somewhere.

_"Who's there?"_ said Jiminy, trying to not raise his voice

_"I'm here,_ Jiminy Cricket." said the fairy girl in front of him...

---

In Chicago, Shelly looked worried to Astra during one of their patrols.

_"What happened?"_ said Astra

_"Didn't you felt?"_ said Shelly _"Looks like another TA's bio-seed was engaged..."_

Shelly was Astra best friend, an origin chaser that killed herself trying to fly over the window, thinking that would made her goes through the breakthrough. In her last moments, the Teatime Anarchist made a deal with her: to be quantum-duplicated into a future computer system, and them  sometime after put her back in contact with her best friend, Hope Corrigan, capename _Astra_. In the adventures they had, she was first a quantum-ghost into Astra's mind, then a conscience downloaded to a Vernetech gynoid called Galathea, then a girl with a extraordinary learning capacity, and them both the girl _and_ the quantum-ghost that operated Galathea "remotely", both at the same time and with some conscience sharing. In fact, she was at that moment _gestalted_ into a single conscience with the quantum-ghost.

_"How could it be this if he's dead?"_ said Astra

_"Duh!"_ said Shelly, in his best Shelly-face _"Fact: the TA is a time-traveller. In our present he's dead_ but _for his own timeline maybe not. It's a paradox, sure, but in the end it doesn't violate any kind of 'time-travelling physics'. And fact: as I'm linked with Shell, my quantum-ghost twin sister, I can feel if some of them would be activated."_

_"Do you think that TA could gave for others the bio-seeds?"_

_"The Future Files and the Ourobouros Files shows this is possible: the TA is kind of a_ Bene Gesserit, _even being a man, and not the_ Kwizat Haderach. _He always had, or has, plans inside plans inside plans."_ said Shelly

_"Looks like him."_ said Astra. _"But why now?"_

_"Looks like it's business."_ said Shelly _"I think I know!"_

_"What?"_

_"It's_ another _quantum-ghost twin sister!"_ said Shelly

_"What?!"_ said Astra _"How much TA could do of this?"_

_"It's a quantum-ghost, duh!"_ said Shelly _"A digital copy of myself at my 'last moments'. It's like a music CD or downloading music into an iPod: as far you have storage and the means, you can copy it indefinitely. I don't think there's he could do too much of them, but certainly he can do some extras if needed."_

_"And where it is..."_ said Astra

_"Somewhere in Africa, Tunisia."_ said Shelly. _"It's like she's trying to contact me for some reason... It's about that hero kid!"_ she gasped _"Jiminy Cricket, from_ Herós Sans Frontières!"

_"The one that Blackstone was talking with during_ Metrocon?" said Astra

_"Yup. The Future Files about him were really complex, but looked like he was okay, but now... Maybe we should go for Blackstone."_ said Shelly

_"Okay."_ said Astra _"But, unless your_ other _quantum-ghost twin sister says he's in real real danger, let us finish the patrol. I don't want to make Blackstone waste his preciously few free time with Chakra for nothing."_

_"Alright, but as soon we get back to the Dome, we'll talk Blackstone ASAP, even if he and Chakra are..."_ 

_"SHELLY!"_ yelled Astra, entertained and ashamed.

_"Looks like something really serious, and Blackstone would like to know."_ said Shelly

_"Okay."_ said Astra _"Let us finish the patrol, so."_

Jiminy looked to the weird girl in front of him, dressed like Disney's _Blue Fairy_, wings and tiara and even the fairy wand. Jiminy was accomplished with tiny girls in fairy dresses and wings: heck, Sugarplum ___was___ basically this way in combat. But the main problem is that he doesn't recognized her from all things he learned about capes and, heck, one of the main powers of _Masterminds_, those like him, was _Eidetic Memory_: as for an Atlas fly, and for an Ajax punch, and a Merlin do magic, it was natural for a Mastermind being a memory many levels beyond the "common" one. And Jiminy read the _Barlow's Guide to Superhuman_ end to end, back to front to know at least all the main rosters from the main cape teams around the world, and none of them included the _Blue Fairy_.

_"Who are you?"_ said Jiminy, trying to touch the woman like he did with Sugarplum, but he felt his hand in the air, passing through her: no mass, no nothing touching his hand. _"Are you magical?"_ 

_"Well, you can always says that_ 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' _FYI, this is the_ Third Clarke's Law. _I think the Teatime Anarchist said you that help would come for you, right? Well, I'm the Cavalry!"_ said the weird _Blue Fairy_ taking a call trumpet that showed out of nothing and playing it like in those cheesy western movies.

Jiminy was worried, but he calmed himself enough to get more lucid: being mingled with so many kinds of capes make this on you, and HSF assured that all teams had almost all kinds of heroes he could. So, he could understand that somehow that _Blue Fairy_ is linked with the Teatime Anarchist.

_"Hey, liked this name:_ Blue Fairy. _Blue Fairy and Jiminy Cricket. We just need Pinocchio, right?"_ said the girl, smiling

_"How do you know about this?"_ said Jiminy

_"I'm linked to your mind, duh!"_ said the _Blue Fairy "I'm a quantum copy of a girl that, in the past, did a great mistake trying to origin chase. Shelly Boyar is my name, if you need something beside a capename for me."_

Jiminy recognized the name:

_"Wait: Shelly Boyar, the remote operator from Galathea?"_ said Jiminy _"But how..."_

_"Hey, kiddo, had heard what I said? I'm a quantum copy of her, duh!"_ said Shelly, smiling _"I'm like an avatar into a videogame: run it into two different computers, with two different players and, even the base being the same, they'll go through different path and different ways, doing different things. And fact: I'm a copy of her just before dying a death-by-origin-chasing. Albeit I can contact them, I'm not either_ Shelly _or_ Shell,  _my twins."_ she said, while Jiminy sat into his stool _"During the bio-seeding, I had looked for some data and memories on your brain to mold myself into a better construct experience and to know you better, so the communication between use could be eased. Don't worry, got no dark secret or anything mean you did... Well, maybe except the day you got to the fridge and took some ice cream during the night and you woke up next day with a very big painful laryngitis. But, if this is the worst thing you had did, your parents had a nice good boy. And you deserved that penicillin."_

_"What? How do you... You will not talk about this to anyone, will you?"_ said Jiminy

_"How? I'm connected to your brain, duh!"_ said Shelly, laughing like she heard a incredibly funny joke _"If I talk this to my twin sisters, they would think this as really really funny. Even more when they know how cute you are when taken red-handed after stealing some cookies at night... Or better, some ice cream."_ said Shelly, with a sweet smile. And this made Jiminy blushes.

_"Now, let go for business, because there's not too much time. I'll take contact with my twins at Chicago ASAP. As I just booted up myself now, it will take some time until I can contact them via the quantum computer in the future. I'll explain this better as soon we get out of this."_ said Shelly as soon Jiminy looked flabbergasted. _"And avoid speak 'normally'. No one can see me: what you're seeing is a kind of... how they call now... Ah,_ Augmented Reality _avatar of me that the bioseed connections project directly into your brain's visual center. Neither your eyes are really seeing me."_

_"Alright."_ whispered Jiminy _"But... Have you any kind of blueprints for this base?"_ 

_"Not yet, but working on it."_ said Shelly.

_"So: do you want to me call you Shelly like your 'twins'? And why you are this way?"_ said Jiminy

_"You can call me_ Blue Fairy _to differ me from them, albeit somehow we are all the same. And, about my look: I chose to take a look that could be comfortable to interact with you. And need to said that looked for a clown one, after all that Mimi & Spotty thing. But I saw that you chosen the capename_ Jiminy Cricket _based on Pinocchio and on your powers, I thought it would be funny to be your own Personal_ Blue Fairy." said Blue Fairy, doing a curtsy. _"Someone to hear your complains and someone who will be always here."_

_"Alright."_ whispered Jiminy, when he heard the wheel and it was the dinner.

_"Better for you to take some dinner and bath, and then go to sleep. I'll try to contact my twins in the meantime."_ said Blue Fairy, while Jiminy got to the wheel to take the food tray.

---

_"So, even dead, the Teatime Anarchist can act?"_ said Blackstone.

_"Well, for him, he's not dead."_ said Shelly

_"And now, he gave_ Jiminy Cricket _one of those bio-seeds, like the one Astra used."_

_"Yeah... And my new twin, that called herself_ Blue Fairy, _just booted up and now is with him. She gave me a kind of vision of the cell where he was. Looks like one of those_ Lawrence of Arabia _things."_ said Shelly

_"So, looks like this confirms the intel about a decommissioned_ Légion étrangère, _French Foreigner Legion, base, probably took as war spoil in all this new action the_ Caliphate _provoked by Alsyf Alayat, the Sword Verses. Shelly, if you can talk with_ Blue Fairy, _say her to take all information on sounds and images nearby. Everything we can have of information to trace his position is important. If you have news, bring me ASAP."_ said Blackstone _"Our friends from_ Roque Santeiro _will need this dearly to take some action against_ Alsyf Alayat, _the Sword Verses."_

_"Alright, Blackstone."_ said Shelly _"And I'll try to see for it in the Future Files."_

_"Do it. Everything can help now."_ said Blackstone.

## Chapter 19

It took six days to ready the operation, and it would take some hours to take Jiminy back.

The airplane was getting near the Tunisian Airspace, but its transponder was off: it was a black-op.

_"They brought us the Foxtrot... We'll make them dance."_ said Soldaire, as they were entering the airspace. A crate that would be dropped by and took by Hufflepuff was carrying everything they needed. Dumont, Kuntur, Sugarplum and Djanni, the flyers from team, would be ready to take the team before they hit the ground. If it would not be safe enough to get into Tunisian airspace for too much. Algeria was a little more okay, because Red Crescent, but Tunisia was closing himself as a _Caliphate_ base, local secular forces from Army trying to take back the country from the radicalized forces that took it.

_"The mission is simple extraction."_ said Diana via radio _"We'll take Jiminy and bring him back. The_ rendezvous _will be some kilometers after the Algerian-Tunisian Frontier, in Algerian territory. You have 48 hours to do this all."_ said Diana, on the Earbug, remotely talking with them from _Roque Santeiro "Now, this will be a HALO drop -_ High Altitude Low Opening. _You'll drop now and open your parachutes just 300 feet before the ground. Soldaire, as you're not a flyer or have great constitution when not at the SolArmor, you're the weak spot in the drop. Kuntur, I want you to be ready to rescue him if everything goes wrong. As soon you get into ground, send the signal to the transport get out and them you're at your own."_

_"Roger!"_ said everyone. This was the first time they gone all this on being supervillain.

_"I hate this_ so much!" said Sugarplum.

_"I know."_ said Hufflepuff _"Even more that LionHeart could not go with us because of his parole, and will stay with Cajun and Corin to secure Cabby and the jet at the_ rendezvous."

_"Alright, you lot."_ said Cabby via the Earbug, when they saw a red light going on. _"Time to drop!"_

They pushed the crate and launched it, them they dropped, parachutes at their backs. First the flyers Kuntur, Djanni and Sugarplum. Then Dumont, Hufflepuff and Soldaire. As soon all of them had dropped, the jet turned away back to Algerian space and got back.

This first step was okay: they dropped and Djanni and Kuntur, as fliers, activated the parachutes on the crate, so it dropped safely. Sugarplum got down and used his tricks to charm the region with Glamour and hide them. Dumont, Hufflepuff and Soldaire finished the drop and got out. They took the crate, opened them and beside some bags with their things they took a special thing developed by some Japanese Vernes and gave as a favor to Soldaire: a small box full of little aligned and numbered capsules. In a paper were marked what each paper means. Soldaire took one of them, pressed a button and launched it. The capsule made a POOF and a big black SUV, without identification, had gone in the place. They took also some things and put the crate in the back of the car.

_"Now... We'll get ready: if the intel_ Blackstone _gathered us is correct, we are four hours far from the old French base, and Jiminy has no much more time before being executed. The idea is very simple: Kuntur, Hufflepuff and me we'll do some diversion. Djanni, Sugarplum, Dumont, you'll recover Jiminy. As soon we do this, we'll go for the Algerian frontier ASAP."_ said Soldaire

_"Right."_ said Dumont _"This is so much_ Delta Command _that things can go really Foxtrot."_

_"Jiminy is counting with us."_ said Sugarplum while she, as everyone, where readying themselves. They put the things in the car and got.

---

Jiminy tried to be calm, as he knew that _Blue Fairy_ said she passed on the information about where he is and the guys that kidnapped him for Blackstone, that would forward it to _Roque Santeiro_. But that was his last night for the time Alsyf Alayat gave him. If he was not rescued, he would die or got into Alsyf Alayat trap. He knew that, as soon he converted himself to Islam, the _Sword Verse_ would be used to try to put him under Alsyf Alayat control. And he made his mind, even if everything failed and help didn't came.

In those days, Jiminy did his best to take some good look on all the people that came to him: this provided _Blue Fairy_ with images that, took from Jiminy's mind, she could send via quantum-link comms (_'better accept it just works.'_ thought Jiminy) to their quantum twins, that could sent it for _Roque Santeiro_, including any juicy intel Blackstone and Shelly/Shell could provide.

It was when, after a little he woke up into his last day, he saw they passed an extra package, with his costume, cleaned, folded and perfumed, almost as new, and a paper:

_"We'll get in into an hour. No talk. Take a bath and eat, then dress up yourself with your costume. Put the Holy Qu'ran in your pocket."_ the flamboyant calligraphy said.

_"Looks like it is your 'Last Meal'"_ said Blue Fairy.

There was when the wheel spun and he saw a tray with 'common', American, food. Not the Arabic food he was eating, but a big, honest-to-gosh bowl of Cheerios and milk, and some toasts with butter and chocolate milk.

_"Sounds like they want to do this by the book: if they kill you, they don't want to just kill, but to do all the execution ritual."_ said Blue Fairy

_"You doesn't turn this easier, you know."_ thought Joshua, going for the shower.

He did as he was saw to do, and then he cleansed himself and dressed into the costume. He felt they had removed everything that could be helpful to him trying to escape, including the contacts that provided energy for the Tesla Arc Gloves. His mask-cam was also broken, but they gave back him his mask and his Top Hat.

Just a moment after finished to dress himself and put the Qu'ran into a pocket from his tails, Jiminy heard the door unlocked. He saw four guys: Alsyf Alayat, the Teleporter that took him at _Roque Santeiro_ and two others. Everyone were dressed into black _ninja_-fatigues and their hoods were lifted. Only Alsyf Alayat was dressed another way, into a pure white tunic. He was also the only one without firearms: he was bringing a kind of dagger, with lots of crystals engraved in the gilded, guardless, handle.

_"Come with us."_ said one of the other man. Jiminy just nodded calmly, and he goes out. They started to talk into Arabic

_"They are saying that you are so calm because they think you saw_ Allah _and so he'll do the_ Shadahah, _surrender yourself for Allah, and, in fact, for them."_ said Blue Fairy, doing the translation. _"By the way, the 'unknown' guys are Tarid Zawahi, B-Class Ajax, and the meek one is Sayd Al-Ankari, 'capename'_ Suleiman. _He's qualified as a C-Class Merlin, and it's said he controls some of the Djinn, as his namesake, King Solomon."_

_"So..."_ thought Jiminy _"He does_ Goetia, _formulaic invoking."_

_"I don't know..."_ said Blue Fairy _"But maybe it is, by what I found on Wikipedia about this."_

Jiminy was almost giving a giggle, but he controlled himself.

The sun already rose, and he was brought to a place outside, and a car was expecting him.

_"Get into!"_ said the Suleiman man.

Joshua was growing panicking. Where they were bringing he?

---

Soldaire and the others got somewhere nearby the base without being seen. Sugarplum got Tink and flew high to look around and over the base.

_"Weird thing, there's a big space they could use for execute Jiminy... But no movement at all by now."_ she said

_"They normally wants this to be very dramatic."_ said Djanni _"Maybe they'll get out with him for a special execution site. Maybe a dune..."_

_"They doesn't even gave people a burial?"_ said Sugarplum

_"For what? In their idea, they are_ Kafir, _infidels. Once someone dies, he or she have a kind of demo on what will happen with him or her in the Reckoning. Some believe that the infidels will be cooked in marble tables during the eternity. Or sinners in general, in fact."_ said Djanni

_"So... Basically, sinners are Devil's Happy Meal?"_ said Sugarplum.

_"Like this, except by the Happy."_ said Djanni, seriously.

_"Sorry, Djanni."_ said Sugarplum, ashamed _"I didn't wanted to mock Islam."_

_"It's okay... We are all very anxious."_ said Djanni, when Sugarplum saw something.

_"There's a car getting out the base, going North. I'm shooting the tracker."_ said Sugarplum.

A kind of weird, pointed, Nerf shaped, device was shot by Sugarplum. It hitted s little below the car bumper, while Sugarplum got back for the car and Soldaire gone and turned the car on. Dumont turned a device on.

_"Let's go. I'll shadow them. Dumont, says me if they turn themselves another way."_ said Soldaire. Sugarplum sat over Dumont's fedora.

They got and gone shadow the car.

---

_"Jiminy, looks like another car is shadowing you... I can't take any comm, and neither can see it directly without you move yourself."_ said  Blue Fairy.

_"Still try talk with them."_ thought Jiminy, with his eyes closed.

_"Kid, open your eyes now!"_ said the Tarid guy.

_"Forget him."_ said Alsyf Alayat. _"Hope Gibril is illuminating him and making him see the sins in his ways against Allah. Maybe this will make him surrender himself to Allah, and reciting the Shadahah, he goes and says that's there's no other God and Muhammad (S.A.W.) his only Prophet."_

_"Stay calm, Jiminy. Sounds like the cavalry is coming."_ said Blue Fairy, when the car stopped in front a place with a camera and a small cushion. 

_"Get out from the car."_ said Alsyf Alayat

After get out the car, the Tarid man gave a strong push that launched him to the ground, making Jiminy kneel over the small cushion. _"Alright, Jiminy Cricket. It's time to chose if you want to go to the Hell or you'll surrender yourself to Allah."_ said Alsyf Alayat. Jiminy saw that the camera was recording or streaming what's happening.

_"This is pointless."_ said Jiminy _"You would never accept me as part of_ Ummah. _In fact, you would always look me as an infidel, and you would try to kill me first chance, even turning me into a suicide bomber as soon I gone useless. So, I say no!"_ shouted Jiminy, when he felt the Sword Verses slapping him hard.

_"We gave you the chance to surrender yourself to Allah, saving either body and soul."_ said Alsyf Alayat, angry, putting Jiminy knelt in the cushion, holding him by his hair, his hat aside. _"But you revealed yourself as a_ Kafir, _an infidel, and a Crusader that mocks our faith. So, I proclaim you enemy of the_ Ummah _and sentence you, in the name of Allah the Most High, to Death. And Allah will give you justice in the Reckoning!"_ said Alsyf Alayat, sacking his _Janbiya_, reading to cut Jiminy's throat.

Jiminy felt despair like the first time he was attacked by Kyle and undergone breakthrough, as soon he could see the silvery light from the _Janbiya_ dagger, and he looked and prayed for his parents.

And Alsyf Alayat passed the dagger through Jiminy's throat...

---

_"They stopped, Soldaire!"_ said Sugarplum _"Let me get out. I can go Tink and buy some time for us if needed."_

_"Alright."_ said Soldaire, stopping a little far away from the other car. They could see the camera and the four guys getting out the car with Jiminy. _"Be ready to get out of the car as soon as possible. Djanni and Kuntur, as Atlas you're the fastest ones. Engage the Teleporter, Rashid Bahri, and their Ajax, Tarid Zawari. Me and the others will engage Alsyf Alayat and the Suleiman guy."_

_"Roger."_ said Djanni and Kuntur, when they opened the doors from the car, in the same time Alsyf Alayat slapped Jiminy and readied himself to cut Jiminy's throat.

_"No way you'll cut Jiminy's throat!"_ said Sugarplum, pushing her fairy wand and shooting the best ward she could, and putting it as discretely she could. When she saw no blood spilling from Jiminy's throat, her saw she did her job good.

_"Go go go!"_ said Soldaire, while everyone ran to engage the tangos.

---

... and Jiminy didn't felt anything.

Alsyf Alayat looked worried when he saw no blood spraying from Jiminy's throat.

Jiminy then reacted by instinct, by throwing his elbow against Alsyf Alayat, and hit it straight between his legs, which make Alsyf Alayat scream and drop the _Janbiya_ dagger, which Jiminy took, taking with the other hand the dagger's sheath from his hands.

_"Hey, Jiminy, look like your Sugarplum friend is really powerful."_ said Blue Fairy _"She did the protection magic that make your throat stay as it is now!"_ 

_"Okay, but let us fight my way out!"_ he said, when he saw the teleporter guy trying to get near him, blocking his way. 

But before he could touch him, he saw a shadow hitting him straight in the side.

_"Maybe you need a Jiminy Cricket to put you in a good way,_ Jiminy Cricket." said someone, smirking

_"Djanni!"_ said Jiminy, smiling.

_"Talk later. We'll take you back home."_ said Djanni

_"And..."_ was asking Jiminy

_"Forget those_ murtadd. _We'll deal them another time!"_ said Djanni, when he felt someone shooting to him.

_"There will be no other time for you,_ Zindiq!" said Alsyf Alayat, already recovered from Jiminy's attack, and really furious

Jiminy looked around: he saw Soldaire and Kuntur engaging the Ajax, while Sugarplum and Dumont joined themselves on Suleiman.

And the teleporter woke up and took Djanni, jumping away from Jiminy, while Alsyf Alayat was looking to Jiminy.

_"Now, without the_ Zindiq... _I tried to at least give you a clean death. But important thing, you'll have brimstone in the Hell!"_ said Alsyf Alayat, locking a submachine gun and pointing to Jiminy.

It was when, again, Jiminy felt a great surge of grim futures on his _Bellax Analytica_. If it wasn't his improvement on control since the events the last year, he would be screaming and rolling in the ground like a kid in pain, but the headache was growing. Even Alsyf Alayat could see something was really wrong...

And it was the sands started to lift...

---

Sugarplum and Dumont were engaged on the Suleiman guy, that fought by launching fireballs against both of them. Sugarplum protected them with her _Geasa_ magics, and Dumont used his Tesla Arc Cannons to shot lighting bolts against him, that jumped away, gracefully floating based on his magic powers while the ground where he was just moments before were calcinated and turned into glass by the powerful electric shots from Dumont.

_"It will never end!"_ said Dumont _"Even B-Class, this guy is really experienced. Maybe a_ Caliphate War _veteran."_

_"He looks like tired..."_ said Sugarplum when he saw him cutting his own hand palm with a knife, and Sugarplum screamed in the Earbugs!

_"Everyone, be ready for a big Charlie Foxtrot!"_ said her

_"What?"_ asked Soldaire

_"He'll try to use_ Goetia!" said Sugarplum while the guy chanted and scribbled an invocation circle in the sand with his own blood _"And a big one, by the magical resonance! Be ready for any kind of creepypasta!"_

_"Soldaire,_ Pepito Grillo _is not well!"_ said Hufflepuff _"Looks like is being affected by this_ Brujaria."

_"Go on him!"_ said Soldaire _"Take him and get out here as soon as possible!"_

Hufflepuff ran near Jiminy and Alsyf Alayat. He took Jiminy and just gave a little push aside Alsyf Alayat.

_"If you want to get alive,"_ said Hufflepuff, pushing Jiminy with him, while running _"run now!"_ when the sands intensified

_"It's a sandstorm, you fool!"_ said Alsyf Alayat "Allah _is enraged with you. A_ Djinn _is coming!"_

_"This guy is in trouble! Looking like he gone too far on his_ Goetia!" said Sugarplum, when they saw Suleiman looking flabbergasted and terrified, when a big mass of sand assumes the form of hideous man, with horns and a bat-like wing, made of sand, and that made a terrible face.

He man looked terrified, and tried to run, when the sand demon took him with his sand made hands, lifted him and just "ate" him, letting him fall inside his sand made body, everyone seeing Suleiman's body being grinded by the high speed sand inside it, his meat and blood growing into a big mess in the demon's body!

_"This creature is crazy!"_ said Hufflepuff, getting with Jiminy, that looked uneasy. They could see Djanni getting back with the Teleporter guy knocked out.

_"Sorry, I took some time to find you back, but this was easy to deal with!"_ said Djanni, looking for the demon _"What the..."_

When they saw Alsyf Alayat looking for it also.

_"It is_ Valac! _You fool, Suleiman! You were never as strong as the real Suleiman (Peace with Him)!"_ said Alsyf Alayat. Then he saw that either his teleporter and his Ajax were also defeated! The Teleporter was with a Sandman bag over his head, and his Ajax was knocked-out and under Blacklocks.

_"No way you'll catch me alive!"_ said Alsyf Alayat, trying to run to his car, while the Valac thing took him also, and lifted, while he was saying, desperate. _"I'm_ Alsyf Alayat, _the Sword Verses! I'm the prophesied_ Mahdi _to cleanse Earth from the infidel's stench!"_

Not that it made any difference for the demon, the Djinn, when it released Alsyf Alayat over his mouth, and they could hear him scream panicking, passing through the sand mouth and throat, until hitting the sand thing's guts, a whirlwind of sand, fast enough to skin and mince Alsyf Alayat into mincemeat and grinding his bones, almost disintegrating him. It was when the creature looked for the _Légion étrangère_ base that was now a _Caliphate_ bunker and started to give steps until them.

_"And this is what happens with those in_ kibria'." said Djanni.

_"It's not over yet!"_ said Jiminy, when looking the monster, that looked for them.

Everyone dispersed, but Jiminy froze, while the big sand hand gone and took him!

_"JIMINY!"_ screamed Kuntur and Djanni.

Jiminy got away from the freeze and start to move himself, until he felt the _Janbiya_ and, for some reason, he used it against the demon's hand.

The demon felt the hit and released Jiminy, screaming in pain. Jiminy was took in the air by Djanni, but he was still shaken...

_"Let's get out! Go go go!"_ said Soldaire, still on his SolArmor, in the pilot seat, everyone getting into the car.

_"What we should do?"_ said Sugarplum, while Soldaire hitted the gas pedal on the SUV _"We are in enemy territory, but that Valac thing will kill everyone nearby. And looks like he grows in power after each kill. It's like he grows absorbing human life force... Or souls."_

_"We can't just get out!"_ said Jiminy, shaking like he was having chills _"This is a potential_ Omega Event! _If we want to stop it, we need to stop it NOW!"_

_"Hey, if they hadn't took you, this would not happen!"_ said Sugarplum _"To be honest, I'm for just get out and save our own  bacon... Sorry, Djanni!"_ she said, looking that Djanni was angry _"We need to take care of us: and we have less then 36 hours to get back Algeria, or we'll lose our_ rendezvous."

_"But I think Jiminy is right."_ says Soldaire _"No matter what the_ Caliphate _did, and even we being here as_ villains, _going black-ops, they need our help, even doesn't deserving it."_

"'If anyone fulfills his brother’s needs, Allah will fulfill his needs; if one relieves a Muslim of his troubles, Allah will relieve his troubles on the Day of Resurrection.' _The Prophet (S.A.W) teached us to help others, no matter what.”_ said Djanni. _"They can't deal this one by their own: Suleiman and Alsyf Alayat were the strongest on this bunker. Besides, using_ Suleiman's _magic to control Djinn is not an easy thing, and that guy messed things hard by invoking one of the most powerful one, that turned into a Lord in Hell!"_

_"Alright."_ said Soldaire _"Anyone against besides Sugarplum?"_ he asked

_"Looks like I'll be outvoted..."_ said Sugarplum, shrugging _"That_ Goetia _thing is a big creepypasta, and I can't work my magic against him directly, as I don't know a nothing of_ Goetia. _So, at least let us try to do something on this that could help us somehow."_

_"The camera is still streaming."_ said Djanni _"We can use this to show them we are not warmongers. They already saw Alsyf Alayat being killed by this Valac."_

_"Okay!"_ said Soldaire _"But first, let us care for Jiminy."_

_"I'm okay..."_ said Jiminy, panting a little, but better _"I'm concentrating and the worst from a oversurge already passed out."_ 

_"How did you escaped that creature?"_ asked Kuntur

_"I used this dagger he tried to use to kill me."_ he said, showing it. Sugarplum reacted a little worried. _"What?"_

_"This is an Orichalcum dagger. It's a kind of magical anathema."_ said Sugarplum _"It's made to fight and sever the magical energy link for any Merlin or Supernatural cape... Or thing. Just sheath this thing back, it gave us Merlins the willies."_ said Sugarplum, and Jiminy sheated the dagger back.

_"This is good news."_ said Dumont _"If he can be affected by Orichalcum, powerful energy fields also can do it. Gain me some time and I'll MacGyver something to catch that guy and destroy him with the things we brought."_

_"Sugarplum, do you think you can help Dumont?"_ said Soldaire

_"I don't know... Mixing Merlin magic and Vernetech is like mixing hot water and boiling oil."_ said Sugarplum _"But if needed, I can create a strong enough_ Geasa _to contain it for a time. I don't know how much, but I think it will be time enough."_

_"Alright... Looks like the best plan we can do now. Let us get back to that bunker or nearby."_ said Soldaire, when he saw some guys getting away from the place, using jeeps and SUVs

_"They are leaving people behind!"_ said Sugarplum

_"They were never with the_ Ummah. _As soon they saw they would had problem, they ran away."_ said Djanni.

They arrived at the empty base when they started.

_"Okay... Sugarplum, you and Dumont works into your shows. Jiminy, I want you to coordinate our moves with_ Bellax Analytica. _The others, let us buy time for them."_ said Soldaire

_"Now, in the trunk there's some swords and other weapons made on fake Orichalcum: a simpler version of Orichalcum and not too powerful, but good enough to deal with this thing by now. Besides, Soldaire, your SolPistols are energetic enough to deal some damage on this thing."_ said Dumont, while collapsing the trunk, a Vernetech one that was, in fact a kind of portable workbench for Vernes.

_"I forgot to say: they broken my mask-cam and the Tesla Gloves!"_ gasped Jiminy

_"We thought on this and brought you a costume change if you want to engage. Take it."_ said Soldaire, giving Jiminy a box with a new costume exchange

_"Maybe it's a good idea, for the_ Gloves _and the_ Cricket _pistols."_ said Jiminy.

Jiminy changed his clothes, besides his shirt, waistcoat and pants. He now felt more confident, and when he took the new Jiminy Cane, he was ready for action.

He was back as Jiminy Cricket.

_"Jiminy, let me engage your mask-cam! And I want to present myself for the others."_ said Blue Fairy.

_"There's nothing you can do by now. Let us do this on a better time, okay?"_ said Jiminy

_"Pinky-finger promise?"_ 

_"Yes! Scout's honor!"_ said Jiminy, doing _Cub Scout_'s salute

_"Alright! Let's go!"_ said Soldaire

Jiminy looked around in the now empty base and saw a tower that gave him enough vision. He asked Djanni to fly him to it before he could go with the others engage Valac, except Sugarplum, that could be heard humming some chanting to do his magics, and Dumont, that was frantically working into something, using the tools and materials into the Verne trunk.

Jiminy took a look all around when gone in the top of the tower and said: _"Right, there's three news: good, bad and even worse. Good: this guy is slow. Bad: there's not too much distance between the city and it. Worse: we are in his way."_

_"Okay,_ Pepito Grillo!" said Kuntur, while slashing him a little, but the thing doesn't look like gone weaker, when the cut was regenerated. 

_"It doesn't work!"_ said Djanni, slashing a lot _"He's too much massive: no matter how deep we cut, he grew it back!"_

_"He is going slower!"_ said Jiminy _"Just take care, looks he will attack you."_

And, in fact, it turned to them and started to attack.

_"Jiminy, there's comms from the local Army. What we say?"_ said Blue Fairy.

_"Say them to simple_ 'GET THE HECK OUT OF HERE!'" said Jiminy

_"Who are you talking with, Jiminy?"_ said Soldaire, shooting his Power Cannon, a big RPG like weapon that gave big energy shots, that looks the only thing that hurts Valac a little more.

_"Later, Soldaire. No time to talk. We deal with this thing and then I'll talk you all my story."_ said Jiminy

_"Alright... Sounds sensible. Deal with monster now, talk about imaginary friends later!"_ said Soldaire

_"Hey, I'm not an imaginary friend!"_ pouted Blue Fairy, hearing via auditory nerves Jiminy comm _"Asked them to get out."_ said Blue Fairy _"They said they'll make a circle if we fail."_

_"Okay..."_ said Jiminy. _"Sugarplum, Dumont, how much time?"_

_"I'm almost ready, Jiminy."_ said Dumont _"Just finishing some energy stabilization: we don't want to do the Tel Aviv here, right?"_

_"Okay. Sugarplum?"_

Nothing...

_"Looks like we need just a little more time. Sugarplum is finishing her mojo!"_ said Jiminy.

_"We can't contain it too much more!"_ said Djanni

_"Get back!"_ said Sugarplum _"Just get back: I'm holding my magic shield, but can't do this for too much time."_

_"Okay!"_ shouted Soldaire _"Retreat. Back to the bunker!"_

They retreated, and Jiminy saw Sugarplum releasing his magic, doing a big circle with her fairy wand, a bright green shade showing the magical shield engaging.

_"And you, Dumont?"_ said Jiminy

_"Almost there!"_ said Dumont

_"How much time?"_ said Soldaire

_"Two minutes, and then I need Djanni or Kuntur to bring me where Jiminy is."_ said Dumont.

_"Alright."_ said Soldaire

The sand monster stopped when hit the shield and started to punch it, small pieces of green dust-like energy shards getting away.

_"This thing is too much strong. My spell will not hold too much time! Dumont, go on!"_ said Sugarplum

_"Done! Djanni, bring me there!"_ said Dumont, holding a kind of mishmash of electronic and steampunk-like things.

_"Okay!"_ said Djanni, taking him

Jiminy was looking for the sand monster.

_"Let this to me."_ said Jiminy, taking the weapon Dumont MacGyvered so fast.

_"Hold it, Jiminy!"_ said Dumont _"This is a high-powered plasma weapon! It's like_ Ghostbusters _weapon, real life. And, considering the power, there's a hell of recoil! And if this thing explodes, you'll be crisp to atoms!"_ 

_"So, even you could not handle this."_ said Djanni _"But I'm an Atlas, and this is where we shine."_

Djanni held the weapon.

_"Kuntur, now I need you take me and Jiminy down in front of the field, nearby the monster."_ said Dumont

_"What? Are you crazy, Dumont?"_ shouted Kuntur

_"Sounds a better idea than let this creepypasta loose."_ said Sugarplum 

_"Alright."_ said Kuntur, and place them where he was needed.

_"Now, Jiminy, as soon he opens a big enough hole in Sugarplum's shield, say us. Djanni, this weapon will release a big energy field, concentrated to hit him. As soon he'll be shot, he'll go crazy. Jiminy, I'll need you to use your_ Bellax Analytica. _As soon he opens some holes nearby his feet or somewhere else, give the sign and launch this device I'm giving you."_ said Dumont, giving Jiminy a small steampunk version of the Ghost Trap from  _Ghostbusters. "When the sand looks like engulfing the device, hit the switch. Hope this works."_

_"Hope?"_ said Jiminy

_"Well... To be fair, our fate in case of failure would not be worse than be devoured by a demon thing."_ said Dumont

_"You are not helping, you know."_ whined Jiminy.

Jiminy looked to the big sand demon and waited until he putted his head into a space in the shield and started to stomp it and screamed like hell.

_"Now, Djanni!"_ said Jiminy

Djanni activated the thing, that looked and was sized as a Gatling gun. The recoil was strong, but he held himself and directed the energy to the body of the sand thing, that punched two big holes in the ground.

_"Now, Jiminy!"_ said Dumont, throwing his trap thing against one of the legs, Jiminy to the other.

Both hit the switches at the same time, and the energy field released started to push the thing like  he was being pushed by a wheel, until his body was split aside, the energies flowing to the traps. 

_"Is that thing finished?"_ asked Jiminy, looking for the traps that were releasing lots of steam and some bouts of static shock.

_"By now, at least."_ said Dumont  _"Hope that it for once. But we can leave this for some local Merlin deal with him. I think he's angry and frustrated enough to just want to get home."_

_"Like me... I just want to catch the clothes they made me use as memento."_  said Jiminy 

_"Okay... And we want to know about that_ Blue Fairy _woman that helped us... And... To be fair, where she is?"_ asked Sugarplum. 

_"She's looking for us, we could say... But I'll explain while going back home."_ said Jiminy 

_"Jiminy, the Tunisian Army is asking who you are. They saw the_ Caliphate _operatives running away and they decided to take this base back to regroup and preparing a counter-attack against them."_ said Blue Fairy 

_"Says we're from_ Roque Santeiro, Herós Sans Frontières. _And that we're going home."_ says Jiminy. 

## Chapter 20

> "Alsyf Alayat'_s situation was solved very quickly, and lucky for us on this. I believe that, if he didn't pushed so hard on us by trying to kidnap me, he could had won us. He was really strong, in a different way. People can understand and fight super-powered Atlases or Ajaxes:_ Seif-Al-Din _was one of them, and there's lots of police and military training focused on deal with super-powered villains. But the_ Sword Verses _is different: he could, for many people, looks like a meek guy, and then he could launch minions, even people beside you, as sleeper agents. I can somehow understand those most paranoid: many of the most dangerous breakthrough are those whose powers are not obvious."_
>
>  **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

_"So, the main objective of_ Alsyf Alayat _when kidnapping you was to take intel about Derek Kwazani and BED."_ said Diana, while Jiminy debrief on all the events, back Roque Santeiro.

_"Right. At first, I believed he was interested into my_ Pretty Please!, _but the Teatime Anarchist was right: he wanted BED. I believe that the Teatime Anarchist wanted us to deal with him, directly or not. This is why he gave me the bioseed that generated 'Blue Fairy'-Shelly. By doing this, he could put me into Shelly/Shell radar, and the quantum-link could be used either as a 24/7 tracking device and as a way to take some extra intel from inside."_ said Jiminy

_"And,"_ said Blue Fairy, now 'downloaded' to a special holographic device provided by a local Verne _"this way, using the quantum-link network, I could send images for Shelly/Shell and so they could, with Blackstone and Artemis help, gather intel on those tangos."_

_"Incredible."_ said Soldaire _"And now? Because, we already dealt with_ Alsyf Alayat. _So, looks like you finished your job, right?"_

_"I don't know."_ said Blue Fairy _"The TA's_ Future Files _are not clear about what happen now... Besides, as far I know, I could not just shutdown now, as I'm integrated into Jiminy's mind. Need to say that I'm not detectable by common exams from your time."_

_"So, would you like to still with me?"_ said Jiminy

_"There's no other way..."_ said Blue Fairy _"Besides, I don't think a good boy like you could be difficult to deal with."_

_"We just need to set some privacy boundaries."_ said Jiminy

_"I know... Boys are boys. Hope you doesn't make me see any gross..."_ said Blue Fairy, when they saw Jiminy Cricket blushing

_"Hope you didn't..."_ said Sugarplum, half disgusted, half entertained

_"NO!"_ shouted Jiminy in despair.

_"Don't worry, Jiminy."_ said Djanni

_"Calm down,_ muchacho." said Hufflepuff _"We are not asking about this. You're a kid, after all."_

_"Well..."_ said Jiminy, trying to exchange topics _"So, I think we'll still together, Blue Fairy"_

_"Yeah, Jiminy Cricket. And your parents, can I know them?"_ said Blue Fairy

And she knew them and they knew her: it was weird to explain that a quantum copy of a formerly-deceased-now-resurrected origin-chaser girl from the time she tried to origin chase had implanted into their 11 year-old kid via a 22nd Vernetech, by the Big Bad Super-Villain Teatime Anarchist, but after all they heard, they were happy that Blue Fairy was there to help Jiminy.

_"Now, sweetie, what do you think coming back to Geneva for your day off? And there's a certain request for you."_ said his mother.

_"What?"_ said Jiminy

_"It's Mrs. Loretta."_ said his father.

Mrs. Sally Loretta was his English teacher on school until the day he had undergone breakthrough, and she was the one that defended Jiminy and other kids that suffered bullying the most. But she was always outvoted when she asked for more rigid rules against bullying at school.

_"What happened?"_ said Jiminy, worried

_"Calm down... She's fine. In fact, she knows now about you: looks like some_ paparazzi _gone to your old school when you were being sued. Now... They had a lot of problems with origin chasing. She want you to give a talk for the other kids."_ said his mother

_"They are trying to origin chasing? Any nasty thing I need to know beforehand?"_ said Jiminy

_"Well... Two other kids from earlier classes gone blind trying to use some kind of meds, and a kid almost killed himself by jumping from the school balcony. Now he's in the Hospital, recovering as much as possible from a neck injured that left him paraplegic."_ said his mother, a little down, and that made Jiminy gasp 

_"They are trying to do this after what happened with ME?"_ said Jiminy _"This is crazy! I didn't asked for this! I'm only glad to undergone breakthrough because the option would be death!"_

_"We know."_ said his father _"But... They're kids, doing kid stuff. They don't believe that a breakthrough is something totally life-changing!"_

_"I know."_ said Jiminy _"Say Mrs. Loretta I'll go ASAP."_

Jiminy then asked for some days off and bought himself (or better, his parents bought) the tickets for a Freetown/Lisbon and then Lisbon/New York flights, after that, he gone for Newark. As his house was now down (and they didn't had time or guts to rebuild it), Mrs. Loretta accepted him at home, when he came with a bag of clothes and a notebook into a backpack.

_"Need to say that you had grown nice and strong."_ said Mrs. Loretta

_"Thanks... What can you talk me about the origin chasing?"_ said Joshua

_"The kids are now all proud on you, but some of them are also jealous. I know you didn't asked for this, but they doesn't believe that this is so complicated, and that it's easier to win Charlotte 600_ AND _Indy 500_ SAME YEAR _than undergone breakthrough."_ said Mrs. Loretta _"I know this is a sensible topic, so I will understand if you just say no, but..."_

_"I understand. I've talked with one of my friends, and she gave me some help on what to talk about with the kids."_ said Joshua, while drinking a glass of juice and taking the notebook from the pack.

It was a commotion when Joshua came to the school. To call even more the attention, he gone under costume, and entered by the front door. A lot of the kids came with Jiminy Cricket's Top Hats and photos to sign up. Even some of his former bullies asked for autographs _"for my little sister"_. He gave all the signs he could, but he needed to go forward for the school theater. Before gone to the theater, he passed at the Principal's room and gave a little chat with the Principal. Then, it was the time for him to talk.

_"Well, everyone, I know that recently there was lots of people here that were looking for and tried to origin chasing. As a way to show you that this is not a good idea, I asked someone that, until 3 years before, was in our circle, until undergone breakthrough. Please, Joshua McCarthy, capename Jiminy Cricket."_ said Mrs. Loretta, and then Joshua gone to the pulpit from the theater room.

_"Hello, everyone. I think some of you never saw me in the school, but until somewhat 3 years ago, I was one of you: I was in this same school, studying, playing and learning, and just thinking on homework and funny things, like what to wear at Halloween or so. I had my problems, sure: you can see I'm not exactly big or strong, quite the contrary. But that time I was even smaller and weaker. Didn't help the fact that bullies always liked to pick me up as an easy target. Sometimes, and I would be a liar to say otherwise, I thought on how I could deal with the bullies if I was strong as Ajax, or could fly like Astra or Atlas, or even if I could do magic tricks like Blackstone. I know that you all, specially you that always are picked by bullies, thought on this. Because I thought on this also."_ started Jiminy

_"It was when, sometime 3 years ago, a group of bullies tried to pick me and pushed me to an alley. I tried to ask them this was not good, but they just laugh on me and started to lynch me. I don't know how much time passed, and still today I lose some nights remembering that alley, and my bones being cracked one by one. I just passed by this alley coming here, and it was painful to remember. It was really painful, and I can say for you all: even when fighting Super-villains I was not hurted as much as I was that day."_

_"If you look for_ Barlow's Guide to Superhumans _it's said that_ 'A breakthrough is an unpredictable survival mechanism'. _Because, and this is very important, 90% of all capes pass through the breakthrough after a life-threating situation. There's some fortunated ones, like 9.9%, that just train hard or meditate or otherwise goes through breakthrough after illumination experiences. This is the case of_ Chakra _from Chicago Sentinels. There's a so-rare .1% that is just being born as breakthrough, normally_ Paragons _that goes human-peak on their skills. But, for the other 90%, the way to breakthrough is too much near the highway to death."_

_"In my case, as I said, I heard many of my bones being broken, one by one, when something triggered into myself. I can't say when exactly I developed my powers, but I screamed to the bullies to stop hurting me._ 'Pretty Please' _sounds like a stupid name for a power, but it was the first words I asked to them, before being killed, to stop hurting me and going away. They froze when they heard these words, and I asked them to no more being meanie. And they did exactly as I've said, at least by then..."_

_"But I was still hurt: I was not fortunate enough to receive self-healing powers, like Atlases or Ajaxes. I was still hurt, still bleeding, almost dying, and then I discovered another power... I saw a kind of 'shadow' from a woman coming nearby. It was her that took me home, really hurt. When I came into home, I passed out..."_

_"Do you know what is to wake up from coma? It was what happened to me: one moment, my dad was with my into his lap running to the local ER when I passed out. In the other, when woken up, I was in a bed, plugged to machines, a tube through my mouth and throat. I saw the doctors coming_ before _really coming, and so. I almost lost my mind on this time, until I could either be freed from all the machines and control my mind from seeing parallel futures on my heart stopped and so."_

_"This is the 'price' I've 'paid' to be a cape. In fact, I didn't asked for this: I would love to stay the little kid I was then, maybe on your place, hearing another cape talking to me as I'm talking to you now about origin chasing. But, after what happened with me, I believe that, as for some reason I didn't died, I should put these powers into service. I couldn't just forget them and left all this behind. It wouldn't be fair. And it was when, 7 months later, I arrived at Zurich airport, with my UN_ Lassez-Passer, _the so-called UN Passport, to report for duty at_ Herós Sans Frontières."

_"I know that some of you envy the capes, the breakthroughs. I need to say you: don't. Remember that, beside the fortunate ones that gone under some illumination, the breakthrough is stressful, painful, or both. Sugarplum, one of my teammates, shrunk to a Tinkerbell size when put under gunpoint by some anarchist robbers. Hufflepuff just survived the Event by growing super strong and lifting the rabble from the_ Lucha _gymnasium where he was. His father was not so lucky, dying after being trespassed by a steel bar. Djanni, one of my best friends, had undergone breakthrough while running away from some meanie kids from the refugee camp. Soldaire undergone a strenuous training to be able to don the_ SolArmor _that is his main power source."_

_"By trying to origin chasing, you're risking yourself: normally, if your body doesn't undergo the  breakthrough, and there's no warrant that this will happens, you'll almost certainly die. With luck, you'll survive this, but with harsh side-effects. And, even if you go through breakthrough, there's a chance things goes even worse."_

_"I heard some of you are trying drugs for origin chasing... I'm not here to judge you. I don't want to know which of you are doing this. I'll not call you stupid or crazy. This is not my objective here. My objective here is to warn you. Using drugs, specially those normally used for origin chasing, is dangerous. They have lots of side effects. Even if you go breakthrough by using this, there's a good chance that you go crazy in the process. The breakthrough with them is dangerous because they mess with your mind in dangerous ways for you and others. This is even cataloged as_  psychotic breakthroughs,  _breakthroughs where the people goes crazy and dangerous. In fact, many of those breakthroughs kills people during their breakthrough. As they lose control on themselves and their powers, their danger is so great that normally and unfortunately they need to be killed."_

_"I saw a guy undergoing a psychotic breakthrough, and it was difficult to stop him without killing him. We were fortunate into doing so, and he was even more fortunate by passing through this with his sanity. He is an exception under exceptions under exceptions. Those that undergoes psychotic breakthrough normally can't be restored to their right minds, and so needs to be killed or restrained to avoid casualties."_

_"Think, by one moment, feeling physical and mental pain, real pain. Think that this grew so big it's like you would explode. Think that this makes your mind breaks apart, and make you feel so much rage and pain and suffering that all you want is to relieve it by breaking down everything nearby."_ said Joshua _"This is what can happen with you if you try to go breakthrough using those drugs. It's very, very, very risky."_

_"If you ask me if I like being a breakthrough, surely I'll say yes. But sometimes, I would like to be just a kid like you. In the last 2, 3 years, since I turned a cape, a CAI-certified hero, I have almost no moment of peace with my parents. I had a broken leg, twisted another, had been shot, thrown by a crazy monster, almost roasted to death by one of the old time bullies, put under gunpoint, had frozen in pain when my power gone haywire, held hostage by some_ KKK-_wannabes and kidnapped by a heir of_ Seif-al-Din. _And if you think your homework are a problem, think that I still have to do homework when not saving the world, or daddy or Sugarplum takes my dessert!"_ said Joshua, what made people laugh.

_"I had good times, too: known lots of people, including my best friends. Turned into a inspiration. Known the world and protected it. Did lots of different things. Had lots of fun. And even helped_ Herós Sans Frontières _gather some donations. I can't say by sure I would exchange all this by being with you, hearing other cape talking about all this. But, at the same time, I could not say that I would not be sad to let this all behind. What I want to say is: breakthroughs are not gods. We eat, drink, sweat, piss, cry, laugh, learn, teach, love, hate, live, dream, can do some things and can't do some other things. Beside our powers, we are exactly like you."_

_"One of the best things about breakthroughs is that you never do things alone. For example: I'm not a flier, but Djanni is, and when I need to get somewhere by flying, I need Djanni's help. But, when he needs help to see if he should go and fight goons or not, he counts on me, as my powers, summed up with my training, ensure him I'll take the best decision on this, based on his safety and capabilities. At the same time, Dumont is our expert on technology, as our Verne. I'll put into account when he says that a small needle like weapon is really dangerous. As I put into account Sugarplum knowledge and instinct about magic and so."_

_"You don't need powers to be a hero. This sounds cliche, I know. But cliches are so because they have some truth on it. My job at_ Roque Santeiro  _is more based on my training and experience than on my powers. Sure, my powers helps, but I was trained to do my job using them. Without those training, my powers could be useless at best and misleading at worst. And I also learned lots of other things, even how to triage refugees. I learned lots of things and helped lots of people even without making use of my powers. You can do this things even without being a breakthrough: when I lost my house after a_ Humanity First _attack, people came and brought us food and comfort. There's lots of non-breakthrough people that helps others in bad events: policemen, firefighters, nurses, doctors, teachers, lawyers, even someone like Brick-a-Brack, my clowning teacher."_

_"So, if you want to help people, you don't need to be a cape, you don't need to be a breakthrough. You need to be good with others. You need to want to help. If you help others, if you care for others, you're ALREADY a hero. Even without powers, you'll be as Atlas, Astra, Ajax, Blackstone... And like Djanni, Sugarplum, Dumont... And like Jiminy Cricket too."_ said Joshua, finishing his talk.

_"Now... Anyone have questions?"_ said Joshua.

And they started to ask questions about _Herós Sans Frontières, Roque Santeiro,_ his powers and villains he fought against, like Derek Kwazani and Alsyf Alayat. And they liked to hear all the stories that Joshua had talked to them.

_"Hope you all now understand why you shouldn't go origin chasing. This is dangerous."_ said Joshua, he the other kids agreed with him, clapping hands for Jiminy. 

Then, while they were getting out the theater, Jiminy felt something weird, as he re-engaged his _Bellax Analytica_.

_"Mrs. Loretta, take everyone out the theater, if possible out of the school and call for help!"_ said Joshua, going almost full Jiminy Cricket and running to the school's sport court _"Don't let people get out the building for the playground."_

_"What?..."_ she was saying

_"Looks like there's people getting here and there's the chance of a 'tag'."_ said Jiminy, while getting to the playground _"No matter what, don't let the kids get out to the playground!"_

_"Had you combined a demonstration 'tag' to your school?"_ said Blue Fairy, showing herself into a blue-tinted Mary Poppins cosplay, carpetbag and parasol and all.

_"Not at all..."_ said Jiminy _"Contact local Dispatch: sounds we'll have a situation and soon!"_ 

_"Alright. Spit spot!"_ said Blue Fairy, doing a curtsy and 'disappearing' from his line of sight.

He saw then three guys and recognized all of them.

They were some of the bullies that tried to kill him when he gone breakthrough and than were sent to reformatory.

_"Let me see..."_ said Jiminy _"You had undergone breakthrough also, right?"_

_"Right, crappy."_ said one of them, called Jonathan Leaf _"And you know how it happened, right?"_

_"Yeah... As for Kyle, you were spanked during a riot at the reformatory."_ 

_"Sure... But our powers were not as offensive as Kyle's, and we were smarter than him."_ said another guy, a big Slavic one called Sturm Williams _"We gone low profile after the riot and than we had gone to Whitlow's. Now we are at Hillwood."_

_"So, what you want to do something here? Just get back Hillwood, do your CAI Certification and live your own life. I never wanted to be a breakthrough and I don't want to deal with you."_ said Joshua

_"You don't understood."_ said the last one... It was the only that looked to him when he was almost killed at that corner. He was somewhat nerdy now, and looked like Presto from _Dungeons & Dragons_. His name was Carlyle Galatas, his parents a couple of Greek delicatessen vendors.

_"Jiminy..."_ said Blue Fairy, back into his line of sight _"Have bad news for you... They all are in the_ Future Files. _And need to say: except by that Presto guy, they are really bad sport."_

_"Carlyle, you still have a chance... You can go back to Hillwood and live your life freely. There's kids in the school: an attack here and you'll go to SuperMax!"_ said Joshua

_"No bodies, no problem."_ said Jonathan, launching some razor sharped leaves from his hands.

Jiminy just had time to evade the attack, just feeling yelp from one of the leaves opening a scratch in his face, when he felt a vacuum back on him and his _Bellax Analytica_ engaging. He had time to avoid the punch the Sturm guy tried to gave him using his Jiminy Cane, but he was pushed back by the punch. He saw Carlyle also doing some kind of magic, holding a somewhat stylish rod.

_"Okay, Blue Fairy, what we have?"_ whispered Jiminy

_"The Jonathan guy is, or will be, known as_ Razorleaf. _B-Class flora projector: he can make razor-sharp leaves and vines from his body. The Sturm guy,_ Ballistic, _is a C-Class Teleporter/Ajax, and uses the teleport for punching successively his targets. The Carlyle kid shows under various names, according the Ourobouros Files from Shell and the Future Files, like_ Presto, Elminster _and even_ Vecna. _B-Class Merlin, with a_ Dungeons & Dragons-_eque powers and theme."_ said Blue Fairy, while Jiminy avoided two vines. He had no way to get away from nearby the main building.

_"They know the_ Rules of Engagement _if they study at Hillwood."_ thought Jiminy, when tried to tasered Ballistic, avoiding his punches _"Had they already sidekicked with other heroes?"_

_"No... Just Whitlow's_ Hero 101." said Blue Fairy.

_"Any suggestion of creepypasta coming?"_ asked Jiminy _"For some reason, I can't read Carlyle moves!"_

_"Hope not... If he can take things from the_ D&D Monsters Manual, _he can bring creepypasta enough to make Italian Cthulhu happy!"_ said Blue Fairy, when Jiminy felt a big lighting bolt hitting him straight in the chest, making him scream in pain.

Jiminy had clashed against the wall pushed back by the lighting. Even in pain, he rolled aside to get out the building and to avoid Ballistic's attack, that jumped to smash him and hitted the ground.

He looked for all of them, and he saw that Carlyle was very scared on the power he just released, and by how Jiminy felt.

_"Looks like he didn't understand how deadly his power is and how weak your body is."_ said Blue Fairy

"Pretty Please, _there's people there: if the building fall, you'll hurt them, even kill them."_ panted Jiminy

_"Not my problem."_ said Razorleaf. _"Now, you are the_ hero _here."_ he said, mockingly _"If you can't stop us using that_ Pretty Please _crap, then they will die, and Kyle will sounds stupid."_

_"Jiminy, I know you don't want to hurt people, but there's no way to avoid escalate this just by talking. You saw your_ Pretty Please! _isn't working. They are here not for a hero vs villain 'tag'. This is just a bonus. They are here to kill everyone!"_ shouted Blue Fairy.

Jiminy rose, standing on his feet, and pointed his _Jiminy Cane_ to the guys.

_"Carlyle looks like the only one slightly affected by your_ Pretty Please. _This can ease things for you."_ said Blue Fairy.

_"Carlyle... If you kill them, you'll be hunted as you would never be. Kill innocents, and even some villains will want your head. This is the time you need to do your own choices."_ informed Jiminy

_"Shut up, you little faggot."_ said Razorleaf, using his vines to encircle Jiminy's throat.

_"Jiminy! If you don't fight back, you and all those kids will die!"_ said Blue Fairy.

Jiminy needed no more stimuli. 

He sacked the sword from the cane and used it to cut the vines, making Razorleaf scream. He felt the vacuum formed by Ballistic's teleporting, but using the cane size, he hitted the button for the taser and hitted Ballistic straight in the chest, making he goes unconscious.

_"One down, two left."_ he thought, when he looked Razorleaf screaming.

_"YOU. F---ING. FAGGOT!!!!"_ Razorleaf screamed, making leaves projecting from all his body, many of them hurting Jiminy for real. _"PRESTO, DO SOMETHING AGAINST THIS FAIRY!"_ 

Jiminy was hurt, and he looked for Carlyle.

_"Presto... Carlyle... It's up to you."_ said Jiminy in pain, lots of bleeding cuts on his body.

Carlyle was doing some magical gestures, readying some magic when four Magic Missiles showed over his head...

...and got away from his hand straight to Razorleaf chest, that making him growing in pain.

Jiminy, ignoring the pain over his slashed body, got nearby Razorleaf, tasered him with his Jiminy Cane and sacked from his pocket a Sandman bag, part of his kit. Presto was about to running away, when the local Newark heroes came.

_"Alright, what happened here..."_ said one of them. Jiminy knew him: he didn't used masks, as almost all Newark breakthroughs. Johnny Mascherano was a B-Class Atlas, and one of the main staple for local heroes. _"You again, Jiminy Cricket?"_

_"Not... My... Fault... They just... Came... Attacked... School..."_ said Jiminy, when he fell over the ground in pain and Presto was being chased by the other local heroes into the playground.

_"Sylvia, do the first aid on Jiminy... I'll talk with school people..."_ he said, when Jiminy screamed.

_"DON'T! TAKE... PEOPLE... OUT... THEIR ATTACK... COMPROMISED... STRUCTURE!!!!"_ he shout all he could, even with his pain, when they heard the foundations starting to collapse.

Presto used his power and made some vines get out his magical hat and reinforce a little more the structures.

_"I CAN'T HOLD IT FOR TOO MUCH!"_ he screamed. _"EVERYONE GET OUT!!"_

The professors and kids got out from the building while Presto and the local heroes did his best to hold the building time enough to people get out. Everyone had time to get out before Presto needed to release the magical vines, when the structure collapsed and the building fell down.

Jiminy was exhausted physically and mentally.

_"You did your best, Jiminy. For a non-combatant, you did very well."_ said Mascherano, while the woman Sylvia, called Sylvia Day, did the first aid job, using her _Dragon_ powers to reestablish his _Prana_ lines to improve his healing. _"It was just sad the school had fell... You studied here before become breakthrough and gone to_ Herós Sans Frontières, _right? Mrs. Loretta said me you came for a talk and those other kids came and attacked the school. Do you know them?"_

_"They were part of the bullies who thrashed me almost to death and made me go under the breakthrough. Then they had their own medicine at the reformatory. They had gone to Hillwood and then came to take me into a 'tag'."_ said Jiminy, still feeling a lot of pain.

_"Okay."_ said Sylvia, still touching in a kind of chiropractic treatment. _"I did my best for now. Just doesn't breath too heavy or does fast movements. Two weeks and you'll be as good as new."_

_"Thanks... I feel a little better."_ said Jiminy, while he saw Presto being blacklocked. _"Sir, he helped us in the end."_ 

_"I know."_ said Mascherano, seriously _"But we need to do these things fair and square: he'll be processed back into the system. I think he'll take a good parole, as he did his best to save people, but I think that he'll need to go for SuperMax... Or..."_ said Mascherano. _"Do you think that_ Herós Sans Frontières _would like another hero under parole?"_

_"I think so."_ said Jiminy, while being lifted to get to the ambulance. 

Presto looked to him and said: _"I didn't understood you until now. I think I was ashamed to be what I am, in the end. To be somewhat nerdy. It was weird to develop those_ D&D-_based powers. I was the local DM at the reformatory, and then at Whitlow's and Hillwood..."_

_"That's okay. Take care. Maybe we work together in the future."_ said Jiminy, while being sent to the ambulance. In there, Mrs. Loretta was being cared also:

_"Are you okay?"_ said Jiminy

_"Just a sprained ankle during the run."_ said Mrs. Loretta _"In some days I'll be good. You were incredible."_

_"Thanks... But, if Carlyle didn't changed his mind, maybe there would be no Jiminy Cricket to talk now."_ 

_"I saw... But you did what you could, and no one would blame you. And, in the end, you convinced Carlyle to get back to the good side."_ said Mrs. Loretta _"Now, go sleep a little, while people see for you."_ she said, sitting beside the paramedic while Jiminy was put in the stretcher, and he got back to the hospital.

## Chapter 21 - Epilogue

> _"Sometimes people confound our lives with the comics. We don't live in the comics, fighting a supervillain every day. We do, in fact, a lot of other things, as important or even more important. So, if you think the breakthrough are glamorous, don't. Our life can be as harsh as everyone else, only in other ways. So, for us_ Carpe Diem, _Enjoy your Time, is so important."_

>  **Jiminy Cricket, _"From Dress-up to save up: an underage breakthrough story"_**

Joshua visited the kids that tried origin chase based on himself and had some good talk. Also, he gone for the reopening of the school, into a new building lifted by the local Crew team and using pre-built foundations. Jiminy donated some items for the school do an auction to rebuild the school, including a complete, honest-to-gosh, albeit without the functional Vernetech, Jiminy Cricket costume, and some other items donated by his team.

But it was time to get back Roque Santeiro. A week at Geneva and then back to action at Sierra Leone.

_"Joshua!"_ said Mrs. Loretta. _"I heard you'll not come back Newark. Is it true?"_

Joshua looked for her and she could see eyes of someone that suffered a lot.

_"My home was burned down. I was sued by the one who tried to kill me. I fought again people that tried to kill me before. I brought danger for you. Maybe it's no more safe for me to come. And there's people with super-needs in the world. And as we says in_ Heròs Sans Frontiéres, Super-Help for Super-Needs." said Jiminy.

_"You're right."_ said Mrs. Loretta. _"But... If you want to know: the new building will be called Joshua McCarthy."_

_"I'm glad!"_ said Joshua, taking his bags when the flight was announced. _"Well... Need to go back Geneva."_

_"Your family is there, right?"_ 

_"Some of them: my team is also my family and vice-versa. But taking some days without worries with my parents is all I need now, after all the things that happened since the Metrocon."_ said Joshua, hugging Mrs. Loretta _"But I'll miss you."_

_"Me too... If we need more talks about origin chasing, can we count on you?"_ said Mrs. Loretta.

_"Sure. But it's time to go."_ said Joshua, taking his UN _Lassez-Passer_ and going to the departure gate.

And know he has the feeling he's a world citizen, above all.
