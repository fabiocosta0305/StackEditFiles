## History

Incredably tall for his age, Cloud Giant none the less always has a relaxed smile and a long mess of brown hair that seems to conceal half his face. His clothes are not complicated, just simple cream coloured pants and a yellow vest.

Growing up on a small planet, Cloud was seen as dumb, careless brute. Truth was he was an easily distracted daydreamer who caused problems without really realising it. The monks of the Flying Temple took him in and tried their best to teach him focus. He still tries his best, even with them gone.
