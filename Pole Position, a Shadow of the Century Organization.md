# Pole Position, a Shadow of the Century Organization

> _"From now on, like your parents were, you are the secret force of Pole Position."_ (Zach Darrett for his Nephews)

One of the weirdest organization in the Shadow of The Century, they are split into two big groups:

+ ___Pole Position Enterprises:___ his CEO Zachary Darrett is focused on a new generation of cars: cleaner, faster, more reliable and more versatile for places without reliable roads. Although he never achieved mass market, their over-the-top design is one of most more liked features, aside cutting-edge technology and better efficiency on gas. It also has lots of subsidiaries and side business to support itself and the other divisions. Also, under some very special locations, Pole Position Enterprises do some special, classified projects involving R&D and intelligence and counter-intelligence for the government;
+ ___Pole Position Stunt Show:___ commanded by Zachary's nephews Tess and Dan, this business was heired by them after a weird accident that resulted on their parent's deaths. One of the biggest Stunt shows all around the world, they are booked all around the world to show their driving and stunt abilities. This also serves as a façade for their "side job": they do some field job as a "justice underground force", running against spies and other mean guys all around, specially when nearby where the show is booked in time. 

## The Modules

One of the most cutting-edge technologies developed by Pole Position Enterprises, the _X851 automated driving assistant_ are still an experimental technology, so much that there's only two units of they working for Tess and Dan in their shows. Those systems uses top-of-the-art RISC computer processors, software and comms to power two almost-ready Turing-Level Artificial Intelligences. On the highly customized cars they are connected into, Roadie and Wheels are the perfect partners on the "side job" of Pole Position, to fight crime. 

Still, the biggest problem is that their maintenance is very specialized and they need highly modified cars to do the max they were developed to do: they have no mobility when disconnected from the cars, looking more or less like small portable TVs that shows highly pixelated faces on it. Beside, the X851 project is still on hold: no one knows why Zachary Darrett held the project, but it could be related with the weird accident involving Tess and Dan parents' demise.

## The Characters

Here we'll show the TV Show characters: the Modules Roadie and Wheels, the pet sidekick Kuma and Uncle Zach will be shown as _New Age Heroes NPCs_, beside Kuma that is an Extra

### Tess Darrett

The older of the Darrett brothers, the calm and cool Tess is as calm fighting crime as is driving the old '69 Ford Mustang she heired from her mother after her dead. The car was almost reconstructed from scratch and modified to accept the Special X851-A unit, that she calls _Wheels_. She looks the kind of non-action, girl girly, girl, but this is a mistake: she waits to act, she thinks a lot and plan, but as soon she thinks its time, she's ready for action.

She's a black haired girl on a cowboy style: yellow shirt, brown cowboy jacket, a red handkerchief around the neck and jeans with boots. She's calm and looks for her family to a fault, including the modules and Kuma. She also has a loyalty for family that makes her the _in-facto_ leader, no matter what Dan thinks about this.

#### Stunts [Refresh: 1]

+ ___Plan B___ (Leader)
+ ___Smooth Operator___ (Face)
+ ___X851 Module___ (Pole Position - Gonzo Stunt)  Tess can use a special _X851 Module_, a drive assistant and cutting-edge AI driver assistant that responds for her and those of her trust commands. This Gonzo Stunt represents the special abilities she can ask the module to do for her and the bonuses provided by this on her rolls. Wheels, obviously, can use those himself also
  + ___My Module Wheels is My Friend - LVL 1:___ It works like _Hone, Jeeves_ (Dilettante), but in fact this "butler" is totally integrated in the car. On the downside, this "butler" can't do lots of things a human could do. On the upside, she can ask by Wheels to take them out a scene once per scene and _without_ pay a Fate Point. And, even better, he is in fact created as a _New Wave Hero_ NPC. To take Wheels to get them out a scene, Wheels need to be ___plugged on the modified '69 Mustang___ 
  + ___Hovercraft Mode, Wheels - LVL 2:___ by using this, Tess can engage, when on her ___modified '69 Mustang___ the _Hovercraft Mode_, that provides any special mode like by _Sweet Ride (Wheelman)_ stunt, but can be restricted to those into Tess' trust. Also, she can use the cameras and sensors around Wheels to have the same benefits of _Eye for Detail (Detective)_
  + ___Let see what I can do, Tess - LVL 3:___ using this, Tess can ask for information to Wheels, receiving the benefits of _Encyclopedia Perambula_, _Nice Computer_ and _Boys in the Lab_

### Dan Darrett

The hot-headed of the Darrett brothers, Dan is brash and boastful, almost for his own good, boasting he's lots more competent of ___EVERYTHING___ he in fact is. He's also an womanizer that flirts as much he can. However, he knows how to put apart job and love, and he do the best to fight bad guys. While Tess is the mind, he's the fighter in Pole Position. He also is a very competent stunt driver, and can do all the things Tess can, although he believes he's better than Tess (not true at all) 

He dresses very simply when not on the stunt show driving the Concept Pole Position GT car with his module Roadie: blue shirt and black pants with shoes. He's blue eyes and blonde haired, being bigger than Tess. He's more to solve things very instinctively.

### Daisy Darrett

The little Daisy was only a baby when she lost her parents, and since them she lived in the road, with his brothers Dan and Tess being her family, and their special modules Roadie and Wheels their best friends. he also had received from his Uncle a special pet: the cheeky Kuma, a genetic engineered cross between raccoon and monkey. She "normally" doesn't do the crime fighting stuff, but she had more than her share of action, thanks for her brothers and Kuma.

She's a little red-haired girl, normally using a turquoise shirt and yellow pants with sneakers. She's always with her pet and Pole Position Mascot Kuma with her, no matter what.

#### Stunts [Refresh: 1]

+ ___And Duct Tape___ (Inventor)
+ ___Trust Yourself___ (Brain)
+ ___X851 Module___ (Pole Position - Gonzo Stunt) - Although underage and unable to drive, Daisy can use either Roadie or Wheels modules and can "drive" his brother's cars (in fact, they are on this case driven by Roadie or Wheels), using the same Gonzo Stunts from any of them it's available. 

### Wheels, Tess' Module

Wheel is Tess' Module, that is her partner in the track and while fighting crime. Hooked up into the heavily modified '69 Mustang car she has, he can drive it by himself, use sensors to help her to drive and find shortcuts and so, and he can even drive Daisy away from danger if needed, overcome obstacles with Hydrofoil Mode, where it can go underwater and fly somewhat over the ground, overcoming all kind of bad terrain.

He is the first module build by Pole Position, and so he looks like an old-fashioned small portable TV, with some buttons and so. His "face" is presented on the screen when he's not showing any intel or doing research on the big databases installed by Pole Position on his memory (when he shows lots of random patterns). He's more calm than the other and thinks he's too old for this crime-fighting thing.

### Roadie, Dan's Module

Roadie, Dan's Module, is as brash and boastful than Dan. However, as he has lots of knowledge more than Dan, he's also a tad more wise than Dan. He also likes to "bully" Wheels, saying that he's "ready to go for the dumpyard". However, he's loyal with all the Pole Position guys.

As a module made for the Concept Pole Position GT car Dan drives, his lines are a little more modern and curvy to go smooth with the car. He's "blue faced", instead of the "old green" from Wheels. He's likes to show himself as an updated version of "obsolete" Wheels, but in the end he respects the "old guy"... Even saying otherwise.

### Kuma, pesky Pole Position Mascot

Created on one of Pole Position R&D labs, Kuma is a genetic engineered pet, crossed between a monkey and a raccoon. He's very pesky and like sweets, specially soft drinks. He like to be with Daisy and the others, and sometimes he's the one to bring trouble for Pole Position.

+ ___Pole Position Genetic Engineered Mascot___ _Good (+3)_; ___Pesky Weird Thing___ _Poor (-1)_

### Zacharias "Zach" Darrett, Pole Position CEO

A multimillionaire dilettante with (some says) lots of contracts on all kind of business, Zacharias Darrett could cash big money if he really wanted to. But he is someone with high standards on ethics and moral.

And this was almost his ruin: on an coordinated action, some unknown (at least at the time) business adversary tried to take his normal business over via a hostile takeover, a sabotage action that resulted into Tess and Dan parents' death ___AND___ an killing attempt against him that resulted on he becoming paraplegic, being now limited to locomotion with his wheelchair.

Although those actions were somewhat successfully, it wasn't enough to make the government lose confidence on Pole Position Enterprises. Although things are not as good as were in the past, Zach is still in the business, and as the puzzle maniac he always was, now he's collecting all the pieces for taking those that did this with him and Tess and Dan and payback as much as he can.

Although not a Spirit (perhaps), he was build as one, using the _Pole Position_ Gonzo Role

+ Majored in College - can use an extra Role instead of a Skill, on Fair (+2)
+ Touched an Nerve
+ Modules (Gonzo) - he can use any and all Pole Position X-831 modules. In fact, his wheelchair is in fact a Module!

## The _Pole Position_ Role

Pole Position has some field operatives for their crime fighting and intelligence operations. They normally disguise themselves as pilots, engineers and any other kind of people involved on motorsports. 

+ ___Skills:___ Awareness, Insight, Drive, Resources

### Stunts

+ Home, Jeeves (Dilettante)
+ Sweet Ride (Wheelman)
+ Eye for Detail (Detective)
+ Encyclopedia Perambula (Brain)
+ Boys in the Lab (Inventor)
+ Nice Computer (Dilettante)

As far is known, there's only two _Modules_ that encompass all those stunts into a big _Gonzo Stunt_: Roadie and Wheels. However, the X851 Driving Assistant project is still on the works, so it would not be surprising if there was other Modules ready for other Pole Position Agents. The main drawbacks are the costs involved and the fact that they can be used only on cars with the specific modifications, which involving lots of sensors and actuators installed all around, and maybe some interfaces with the car's electronics.

## Rumors

+ Pole Position is, in secret, a _Golden Seed_: Zach Darrett received lots of money from his deceased friend _Mack Silver_
+ Zach Darrett is, in fact, a Methuselah Fragment, the _good_ one: he knows about the other fragments and is working on a secret agenda against them... Or not!
+ Zach Darrett is a Spirit in hiding: some believe that he could even be _Mack Silver_ itself, working behind the scene, the paraplegia holding himself.
+ Dan and Tess' parents were linked with the Century Club: when the club was outlawed, they were as hunted as the Spirits themselves, and their deaths were an operation to take information about some of the secrets the Club left behind for the good;
+ The accident Dan and Tess parents' suffered was in fact a sabotage did by a rogue element infiltrated in Pole Position by some of their enemies, and Zach knows who did it, growing paranoid on in who he can put his trust on. Some says that it was an action done by Consolidated Holdings Incorporated, and Zach just have not enough proof on it; 


## Pole Position as a Golden Seed

+ ___Agenda:___ evolution on automobile technology and crime fighting, beside discover and push vengeance against those who killed Tess and Dan parents' and put Zach under a wheelchair.
+ ___Resources:___ Although not exactly indefinitely , they have lots of money and installations all around the world, either by themselves and on joint ventures with some of the biggest enterprises on the automobiles and motorsports business
+ ___Patron:___ Pole Position can offer lots of help and cutting-edge technology for those who works for them. Zacharias Darrett's resources are big, either on money and on tech. For the crime fighting, it has lots of contracts, contacts and allies on government. As the top tech, they have the X851 Driving Assistant Modules as a technology to be provided for those who works for them, but they are few and very specific, so only their top agents are granted with them, like Tess and Dan
+ ___Ally:___ Pole Position has the biggest advantage to be loosely connected to the government enough to go low profile if needed, and thighly connected enough to cash some favours and intel here and there. This can be expanded for those who got allied with Pole Position on some situations;
+ ___Contact:___ normally Pole Position doesn't share the juicy intel they have, thanks the events that resulted on Tess and Dan parents' demise. However, they have enough information to be a good contact for those that wanted to get into. Besides, a race track is the last place where someone could think corporate or government intel could be traded (except, maybe, by Monaco);
+ ___Foil:___ Pole Position has few enemies in their double business on track and intelligence, but if they saw someone messing into their business, they can go very inconvenient. They are cool and smooth enough to gather intel to hit you, but as soon you had it, they hit as hard and fast as an V8 Indycar;
+ ___Enemy:___ Although they are into some few numbers, they also are very thighly connected and they don't like people that mess with them. If you want to be a very troublesome enemy, the best way to do this is by messing with Pole Position. Believe: as soon they know you are in the wrong side, they'll fight you as fast and hard as they can, and maybe you'll soon receive some visit to be neutralized as fast as they can. They have high stands on moral and ethics, but they have the guts into them to do what is needed.
